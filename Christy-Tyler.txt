Is that you, Christy?
It is, Ma'am.
I thought the hinny was familiar. 
How is your poor mother?
No better, Ma'am.
Your daughter then?
No worse, Ma'am.
Why do you halt? 
But why do I halt?
Nice day for the races.
Perhaps it is. 
But will it hold up?  
Will it hold up?
I suppose you wouldn't be in need--
Hist! 
Surely to goodness that couldn't be the 
up mail I hear already?
Damn the mail.
Oh thank God for that!
I could have sworn I heard it, 
thundering down the track in the far distance. 
I suppose you wouldn't be in need 
of a small load of 
dung?
Dung? 
What class of dung?
Stydung.
Stydung . . . 
I like your frankness, Christy. 
I'll ask the master. Christy.
 
Yes, Ma'am.
 
Do you find anything . . . 
bizarre about my way of speaking? 
I do not mean the voice. 
No, I mean the words. 
I use none but the 
simplest words, 
I think, 
and yet 
I 
sometimes 
find 
my 
way of speaking very . . .
bizarre. Mercy! - What was that?
Never mind her, Ma'am, 
she's very fresh in herself to-day.
Dung? What would we want with dung, 
at our time of life? 
Why are you on your feet down on the road? 
Why do you not climb up on the 
crest of your manure 
and let yourself be carried away? 
Is it that you have no head for heights?
Wiyya ta hell out of that!
She doesn't move a muscle.
I too should be getting along, 
if I do not wish to arrive 
late at the station. 
But a moment ago she 
neighed and pawed the ground.
And now she refuses to advance. 
Give her a good welt on the rump.
 
Harder!  
 
Well! If someone were to do that for me 
I wouldn't dally.
 
How she gazes at me to be sure, with her 
great 
moist 
cleg-tormented 
eyes! 
Perhaps 
if I were to move on,
down the road, 
out of her field of vision . . .  
 
No, no, enough! 
Take her by the snaffle and 
take her eyes away from me.
Oh this is awful  
 
What have I done to deserve all this, 
what, what?  
So long ago . . . 
No! No!  
"Sigh out a something something 
tale of things, Done long ago
and ill done."  
 
How can I go on, I cannot. 
Oh let me just flop down 
flat on the road like a 
big fat jelly out of a bowl and 
never move 
again! 
A great big slop 
thick with grit and dust and flies, 
they would have to scoop me up with a shovel. 
 
Heavens, there is that 
up mail again, 
 
what will become of me!  
 
Oh I am just a 
hysterical old hag I know, 
destroyed with sorrow and 
pining and gentility and 
church-going and fat and rheumatism 
and childlessness  
 
Minnie! 
Little Minnie! 
Love, love is all I asked, 
a little love, daily, 
 
twice daily, 
 
fifty years 
of twice daily love 
like a Paris horsebutcher's regular, 
what normal woman wants affection?
A kiss in the evening, near the ear, 
and another at morning,
peck, peck, 
till you grow whiskers on you. 
There is that lovely laburnum again. 


Pardon me if I 
do not doff my cap, 
I'd fall off. 
Divine day for the meeting.
Oh, Mr. Tyler, 
you startled the life out of me 
sneaking up beside me like that 
like a deer-stalker! 
Oh!
I rang my bell, Mrs. Rooney, 
the moment I spotted you 
I started tinkling my bell, 
now don't you deny it.
Your bell is one thing, 
and you are another. 
What news of your daughter?
 
fair 
 
fair 
 
they removed 
everything 
the whole . . . 
er . . . 
bag of tricks 
Now I am 
grandchild-less
 
Gracious how you wobble! 
Dismount, for mercy's sake, 
or ride on.
Perhaps 
if I 
were 
to place
my 
hand 
gently
on your shoulder, 
Mrs. Rooney, 
how would that be?  
Would you permit that?
No, Mr. Rooney, 
Mr. Tyler I mean,
  
I am tired 
of light old 
hands on my shoulders 
and other useless places, 
sick and tired of them. 
Heavens, 
here comes Connolly's van!  
 
Are you all right, Mr. Tyler?  
Where is he?  
 
Aah 
there you are!  
 
That was a narrow scrape
I alit in the nick of time.
It is suicide to be abroad. 
But what is it to be at home?
A lingering dissolution. 
Now we are white with dust 
from head to foot. 
I beg your pardon?

Nothing, Mrs. Rooney, 
nothing 
I was only
cursing, 
under my breath, 
God and man, 
under my breath, 
and the wet 
Saturday afternoon of my 
conception. 
My back 
tire has gone out again. 
I pumped it 
hard as iron 
before I went out. 
And now 
I am on the rim.
Oh what a shame!
Now if it were the front 
I would not so much mind. 
But the back. 
The back! 
The chain! 
The grease! 
The brakes! 
The gear! 
No! It is too much!
 
Are we 
already late? 
I have not the 
courage to 
look at my watch.
Late! 
I on my bicycle 
as I rolled along was
already 
late 
now therefore we are 
doubly 
late 
trebly 
quadrupedly late 
would I had shot by you 
without a word
 
Who are you 
going to meet?
Hardy  
We used to climb together  
I saved his life once  
I have not forgotten it
Let us a halt a moment and this 
vile dust 
fall back upon the 
viler worms.
 
What sky! 
What light! 
 
Ah in spite of all 
it is a blessed thing 
to be alive in such weather 
and out of hospital
Alive?
Well half alive shall we say?
Speak for yourself
I am not 
half alive 
nor anything approaching it 
What are we standing here for? 
This dust will not settle 
in our time 
and when it does some 
great 
whirring 
machine will 
come and blow it all 
sky high again
Well, shall we be getting along 
in that case?
No
Come, Mrs. Rooney--
Go, Mr. Tyler, 
go on and leave me, 
listening to the cooing of 
the ringdoves 
 
If you see 
my old blind Dan 
tell him I was 
on my way to meet him
when it all came 
over me again, 
like a flood. 
Say to him, 
Your poor wife, 
she told 
me to tell you it all came 
flooding over her 
again and she  
simply went back 
home 
 
straight 
back 
home 
 
Come 
Mrs. Rooney 
come 
the mail has not yet gone up 
just take my free arm 
and we'll be there 
with time and to spare.
 
What?
  
What's all this now? 
Can't you see Im in trouble? 
Have you no respect for misery? 
Minnie! 
Little Minnie!
Come 
Mrs. Rooney 
come 
the mail has not yet gone up 
just take my free arm 
and we'll be there 
with time and to 
spare.
  
Mrs Rooney ...
About forty now she'd be 
I don't know, 
fifty...  
 
girding up her 
lovely little loins 
getting ready for 
the change ...
 
for the change...
 
Will you get along with you, 
Mr. Rooney, 
Mr. Tyler I mean, 
will you get along with you now 
and cease molesting me? 
 
What kind of a country 
is this where a 
woman can't 
cry her eyes out in the 
highways and byways 
without being molested 
by retired 
bill-brokers! 
 
Heavens, 
you're not 
going to ride her flat! 
You'll tear your tube to ribbons! 
 
Venus birds! 
Cooing in the night
all the long 
summer long.  
 
Oh cursed corset! 
 
If I could only 
let it out, 
without indecent exposure. 
Mr. Tyler! 
Mr. Tyler! 
Come back and unlace me 
behind the hedge! 
What's wrong with me, 
what's wrong with me, 
never tranquil, 
seething out of my 
dirty old pelt, 
out of my skull!
Oh to be in atoms, 
in atoms! 
ATOMS!
 
Jesus!  
Jesus!
