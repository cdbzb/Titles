Miss Fitt! 
Am I then invisible, Miss Fitt?  
Is this cretonne so be- 
coming to me that I 
merge into the masonry?
That's right 
look closely and you will 
finally distinguish a once female form.

Mrs. Rooney 
I saw you 
but I did not know you

Last Sunday we worshipped together 
We knelt side by side at the same altar 
drank from the same chalice 
Have I so changed since then?

Oh but in 
church, Mrs. Rooney 
in church I am alone 
with my Maker 
Are not you?
Why, even the sexton himself 
you know, when he takes up the 
collection, knows it is 
useless to pause before 
me. I simply do not see the 
plate, or 
bag, or whatever it is they use 
how could I?
Why even when all is 
over and I go 
out into the 
sweet fresh 
air, why even then for the first 
hour or so I 
stumble in a kind of 
daze as you might 
say, oblivious to my coreligionists 
And they are very kind 
I must admit
--the vast majority--
very kind and understanding 
They know me now and take no umbrage 
There she goes 
they say, there goes the 
dark Miss Fitt 
alone with her Maker 
take no notice of her 
And they step down off the path 
to avoid my running into them 
Ah yes, I am distray 
very distray 
even on week-days. Ask 
Mother, if you do not believe me 
Hetty, she 
says, when I start eating my doily instead 
of the thin bread and butter 
Hetty, how can you be so distray?
 suppose the truth is 
I'm just not there, Mrs. Rooney, 
just not really there at all 
I see, hear, smell 
I go through the usual 
motions, but my heart 
is not in it 
but heart is in 
none of it 
Left to myself 
with no one to check me 
I would soon be flown 
home
So if you think I cut you just now 
Mrs. Rooney, you do me an injustice 
All I saw was a big pale blur 
just another big pale blur
Is anything amiss 
Mrs. Rooney 
you don't look normal somehow 
So bowed and bent

Maddy Rooney, nee Dunne 
the big pale blur 
You have piercing sight, Miss Fit
literally piercing

Well  
is there anything 
I can do 
now that I am here?

If you would help me up the face of this cliff, Miss Fitt, I have little doubt your Maker would requite you, if no one else.

 Now now, Mrs. Rooney, don't put your teeth in me. Requite! I make these sacrifices for nothing--or not at all. (Pause. 
 Sound of her descending steps.) I take it you want to lean on me, Mrs. Rooney.

 I asked Mr. Barrell to give me his arm, just give me his arm. (Pause.) He turned on his heel and strode away.

 Is it my arm you want then? (Pause. Impatiently.) Is it my arm you want, Mrs. Rooney, or what is it?

 (exploding). Your arm! Any arm! A helping hand! For five seconds! Christ, what a planet!

 Really . . . Do you know what it is, Mrs. Rooney, I do not think it is wise of you to be going about at all.

 (violently). Come down here, Miss Fitt, and give me your arm, before I scream down the parish!

Pause. Wind. Sound of Miss Fitt descending last steps.

 (resignedly). Well, I suppose it is the Protestant thing to do.

 Pismires do it for one another. (Pause.) I have seen slugs do it. (Miss Fitt proffers her arm.) No, the other side, my dear, if it's all the same to you, I'm left-handed on top of everything else. (She takes Miss Fitt's right arm.) Heavens, child, you're just a bag of bones, you need building up. (Sound of her toiling up steps on Miss Fitt's arm.) This is worse than the Matterhorn, were you ever up the Matterhorn, Miss Fitt, great honeymoon resort. (Sound of toiling.) Why don't they have a handrail? (Panting.) Wait till I get some air. (Pause.) Don't let me go! (Miss Fitt hums her hymn. After a moment Mrs. Rooney joins in with the words.) . . . the encircling gloo-oom (Miss Fitt stops humming) . . . tum tum me on. (Forte.) The night is dark and I am far from ho-ome, tum tum--

 (hysterically). Stop it, Mrs. Rooney, stop it, or I'll drop you!

 Wasn't it that they sung on the Lusitania? Or Rock of Ages? Most touching it must have been. Or was it the Titanic?

Attracted by the noise a group, including Mr. Tyler, Mr. Barrell and Tommy, gathers at top of steps.

MR. BARRELL: What the--

Silence.

MR. TYLER: Lovely day for the fixture.

Loud titter from Tommy cut short by Mr. Barrell with backhanded blow in the stomach. Appropriate noise from Tommy.

FEMALE VOICE: (shrill). Oh look, Dolly, look!

DOLLY: What, Mamma?

FEMALE VOICE: They are stuck! (Cackling laugh.) They are stuck!

 Now we are the laughing-stock of the twenty-six counties. Or is it thirty-six?

MR. TYLER: That is a nice way to treat your defenceless subordinates, Mr. Barrell, hitting them without warning in the pit of the stomach.

 Has anybody seen my mother?

MR. BARRELL: Who is that?

TOMMY: The dark Miss Fitt.

MR. BARRELL: Where is her face? 
  Now, deary, I am ready if you are. (They toil up remaining steps.) Stand back, you cads!

Shuffle of feet.

FEMALE VOICE: Mind yourself, Dolly!

 Thank you, Miss Fitt, thank you, that will do, just prop me up against the wall like a roll of tarpaulin and that will be all, for the moment. (Pause.) I am sorry for all this ramdam, Miss Fitt, had I known you were looking for your mother I should not have importuned you, I know what it is.

MR. TYLER: (in marvelling aside). Ramdam!

FEMALE VOICE: Come, Dolly darling, let us take up our stand before the first-class smokers. Give me your hand and hold me tight, one can be sucked under.

MR. TYLER: You have lost your mother, Miss Fitt?

 Good-morning, Mr. Tyler.

MR. TYLER: Good-morning, Miss Fitt.

MR. BARRELL: Good-morning, Miss Fitt.

 Good-morning, Mr. Barrell.


 MR. TYLER: You have lost your mother, Miss Fitt?

 She said she would be on the last train.

 Do not imagine, because I am silent, that I am not present, and alive, to all that is going on.

MR. TYLER: (to Miss Fitt). When you say the last train--

 Do not flatter yourselves for one moment, because I hold aloof, that my sufferings have ceased. No. The entire scene, the hills, the plain, the racecourse with its miles and miles of white rails and three red stands, the pretty little wayside station, even you yourselves, yes, I mean it, and over all the clouding blue, I see it all, I stand here and see it all with eyes . . . (the voice breaks.) . . . through eyes . . . oh, if you had my eyes . . . you would understand . . . the things they have seen . . . and not looked away . . . this is nothing . . . nothing . . . what did I do with that handkerchief?

Pause.

MR. TYLER: (to Miss Fitt). When you say the last train--(Mrs. Rooney blows her nose violently and long)--when you say the last train, Miss Fitt, I take it you mean the twelve thirty.

 What else could I mean, Mr. Tyler, what else could I conceivably mean?

MR. TYLER: Then you have no cause for anxiety, Miss Fitt, for the twelve thirty has not yet arrived. Look. (Miss Fitt looks.) No, up the line. (Miss Fitt looks. Patiently.) No, Miss Fitt, follow the direction of my index. (Miss Fitt looks.) There. You see now. The signal. At the bawdy hour of nine. (In rueful afterthought.) Or three alas! (Mr. Barrell stifles a guffaw.) Thank you, Mr. Barrell.

 But the time is now getting on for--

MR. TYLER: (patiently). We all know, Miss Fitt, we all know only too well what the time is now getting on for, and yet the cruel fact remains that the twelve thirty has not yet arrived.

 Not an accident, I trust! (Pause.) Do not

 MR. TYLER: (to Miss Fitt). When you say the last train--(Mrs. Rooney blows her nose violently and long)--when you say the last train, Miss Fitt, I take it you mean the twelve thirty.

 What else could I mean, Mr. Tyler, what else could I conceivably mean?

MR. TYLER: Then you have no cause for anxiety, Miss Fitt, for the twelve thirty has not yet arrived. Look. (Miss Fitt looks.) No, up the line. (Miss Fitt looks. Patiently.) No, Miss Fitt, follow the direction of my index. (Miss Fitt looks.) There. You see now. The signal. At the bawdy hour of nine. (In rueful afterthought.) Or three alas! (Mr. Barrell stifles a guffaw.) Thank you, Mr. Barrell.

 But the time is now getting on for--

MR. TYLER: (patiently). We all know, Miss Fitt, we all know only too well what the time is now getting on for, and yet the cruel fact remains that the twelve thirty has not yet arrived.

 Not an accident, I trust! (Pause.) Do not tell me she has left the track! (Pause.) Oh darling mother! With the fresh sole for lunch!

Loud titter from Tommy, checked as before by Mr. Barrell.

MR. BARRELL: That's enough old guff out of you. Nip up to the box now and see has Mr. Case anything for me.

Tommy goes.

Mrs. ROONEY: (sadly). Poor Dan!

 (in anguish). What terrible thing has happened?

MR. TYLER: Now now, Miss Fitt, do not--

 (with vehement sadness). Poor Dan!

MR. TYLER: Now now, Miss Fitt, do not give way . . . to despair, all will come right . . . in the end. (Aside to Mr. Barrell.) What is the situation, Mr. Barrell? Not a collision surely?

 (enthusiastically). A collision! Oh that would be wonderful!

 (horrified). A collision! I knew it! 

MR. TYLER: Come, Miss Fitt, let us move a little up the platform.

 Yes, let us all do that. (Pause.) No? (Pause.) You have changed your mind? (Pause.) I quite agree, we are better here, in the shadow of the waiting-room.

MR. BARRELL: Excuse me a moment.

 Before you slink away, Mr. Barrell, please, a statement of some kind, I insist. Even the slowest train on this brief line is not ten minutes and more behind its scheduled time without good cause, one imagines. (Pause.) We all know your station is the best kept of the entire network, but there are times when that is not enough, just not enough. (Pause.) Now, Mr. Barrell, leave off chewing your whiskers, we are waiting to hear from you--we the unfortunate ticket-holders' nearest if not dearest.

Pause.

MR. TYLER: (reasonably). I do think we are owed some kind of explanation, Mr. Barrell, if only to set our minds at rest. 
 	
MR. BARRELL: I know nothing. All I know is there has been a hitch. All traffic is retarded.

 (derisively). Retarded! A hitch! Ah these celibates! Here we are eating our hearts out with anxiety for our loved ones and he calls that a hitch! Those of us like myself with heart and kidney trouble may collapse at any moment and he calls that a hitch! In our ovens the Saturday roast is burning to a shrivel and he calls that--

MR. TYLER: Here comes Tommy, running! I am glad! have been spared to see this.

TOMMY: (excitedly, in the distance). She's coming. (Pause. Nearer.) She's at the levelcrossing!

Immediately exaggerated station sounds. Falling signals. Bells. Whistles. Crescendo of train whistle approaching. Sound of train rushing through station.

 (above rush of train). The up mail! The up mail! (The up mail recedes, the down train approaches, enters the station, pulls up with great hissing of steam and clashing of couplings. Noise of passengers descending, doors banging, Mr. Barrell shouting "Boghill! Boghill!", etc. Piercingly.) Dan! . . Are you all right?. . Where is he? . . Dan! . . Did you see my husband? . . Dan! . . (Noise of station emptying, Guard's whistle. Train departing, receding. Silence.) He isn't on it! The misery I have endured, to get here, and he isn't on it! . . Mr. Barrell! . . Was he not on it? (Pause.) Is anything the matter, you look as if you had seen a ghost. (Pause.) Tommy! . . Did you see the master?

TOMMY: He'll be along, Ma'am, Jerry is minding him.

Mr. Rooney suddenly appears on platform, advancing on small boy Jerry's arm. He is blind, thumps the ground with his stick and pants incessantly.

 Oh, Dan! There you are! (Her dragging feet as she hastens towards him. She reaches him. They halt.) Where in the world were you?

MR. ROONEY: (coolly.) Maddy. 
  Where were you all this time?

MR. ROONEY: In the men's.

 Kiss me!

MR. ROONEY: Kiss you? In public? On the platform? Before the boy? Have you taken leave of your senses?

 Jerry wouldn't mind. Would you, Jerry?

JERRY: No, Ma'am.

 How is your poor father?

JERRY: They took him away, Ma'am.

 Then you are all alone?

JERRY: Yes, Ma'am.

MR. ROONEY: Why are you here? You did not notify me.

 I wanted to give you a surprise. For your birthday.

MR. ROONEY: My birthday?

 Don't you remember? I wished you your happy returns in the bathroom.

MR. ROONEY: I did not hear you.

 But I gave you a tie! You have it on!

Pause.

MR. ROONEY: How old am I now?

 Now never mind about that. Come.

MR. ROONEY: Why did you not cancel the boy? Now we shall have to give him a penny.

 (miserably). I forgot! I had such a time getting here! Such horrid nasty people! (Pause. Pleading.) Be nice to me, Dan, be nice to me today!

MR. ROONEY: Give the boy a penny.

 Here are two halfpennies, Jerry. Run along now and buy yourself a nice gobstopper.

JERRY: Yes, Ma'am.

MR. ROONEY: Come for me on Monday, if I am still alive.

JERRY: Yessir.

He runs off.

MR. ROONEY: We could have saved sixpence. We have saved fivepence. (Pause.) But at what cost?

They move off along platform arm in arm. Dragging feet, panting, thudding stick.

 Are you not well?

They halt, on Mr. Rooney's initiative.

MR. ROONEY: Once and for all, do not ask me to speak and move at the same time. I shall not say this in this life again.

They move off. Dragging feet, etc. They halt at top of steps.

 Are you not--

MR. ROONEY: Let us get this precipice over.

 Put your arm round me.

MR. ROONEY: Have you been drinking again? (Pause.) You are quivering like a blanc-mange. (Pause.) Are you in a condition to lead me? (Pause.) We shall fall into the ditch.

 Oh, Dan! It will be like old times!

MR. ROONEY: Pull yourself together or I shall send Tommy for the cab. Then, instead of having saved sixpence, no, fivepence, we shall have lost . . . (calculating mumble) . . . two and three less six one and no plus one one and no plus three one and nine and one ten and three two and one . . . (normal voice) two and one, we shall be the poorer to the tune of two and one. (Pause.) Curse that sun, it has gone in.  What is the day doing?

Wind.

 Shrouding, shrouding, the best of it is past. (Pause.) Soon the first great drops will fall splashing in the dust.

MR. ROONEY: And yet the glass was firm. (Pause.) Let us hasten home and sit before the fire. We shall draw the blinds. You will read to me. I think Effie is going to commit adultery with the Major. (Brief drag of feet.) Wait! (Feet cease. Stick tapping at steps.) I have been up and down these steps five thousand times and still I do not know how many there are. When I think there are six there are four or five or seven or eight and when I remember there are five there are three or four or six or seven and when finally I realize there are seven there are five or six or eight or nine. Sometimes I wonder if they do not change them in the night. (Pause. Irritably.) Well? How many do you make them to-day?

 Do not ask me to count, Dan, not now. 

MR. ROONEY: Not count! One of the few satisfactions in life? Not steps, Dan, please, I always get them wrong. Then you might fall on your wound and I would have that on my manure-heap on top of everything else. No, just cling to me and all will be well.Confused noise of their descent. Panting, stumbling, ejaculations, curses. Silence.MR. ROONEY: Well! That is what you call well! We are down. And little the worse. (Silence. A donkey brays. Silence.) That was a true donkey. Its father and mother were donkeys.Silence.MR. ROONEY: Do you know what it is, I think I shall retire. (appalled). Retire! And live at home? On your grant!MR. ROONEY: Never tread these cursed steps again. Trudge this hellish road for the last time. Sit at home on the remnants of my bottom counting the hours--till the next meal. (Pause.) The very thought puts life in me! Forward, before it dies!

They move on. Dragging feet, panting, thudding stick.

 Now mind, here is the path . . . Up! . . Well done! Now we are in safety and a straight run home.

MR. ROONEY: (without halting, between gasps). A straight . . . run! . . She calls that . . . a straight . . . run! . .

 Hush! do not speak as you go along, you know it is not good for your coronary. (Dragging steps, etc.) Just concentrate on putting one foot before the next or whatever the expression is. (Dragging feet, etc.) That is the way, now we are doing nicely. (Dragging feet, etc. They suddenly halt, on Mrs. Rooney's initiative.) Heavens! I knew there was something! With all the excitement! I forgot!

MR. ROONEY: (quietly). Good God.

 But you must know, Dan, of course, you were on it. What ever happened? Tell me!

MR. ROONEY: I have never known anything to happen.

 But you must--

MR. ROONEY: (violently). All this stopping and starting again is devilish, devilish! I get a little way on me and begin to be carried along when suddenly you stop dead! Two hundred pounds of unhealthy fat! What possessed you to come out at all? Let go of me!

 (in great agitation). No, I must know, we won't stir from here till you tell me. Fifteen minutes late! On a thirty minute run! It's unheard of!

MR. ROONEY: I know nothing. Let go of me before I shake you off.

 But you must know! You were on it! Was it at the terminus? Did you leave on time? Or was it on the line? (Pause.) Did something happen on the line? (Pause.) Dan! (Brokenly.) Why won't you tell me!

Silence. They move off. Dragging feet, etc. They halt. Pause.

MR. ROONEY: Poor Maddy! (Pause. Children's cries.)


 What was that?

Pause for Mrs. Rooney to ascertain.

 The Lynch twins jeering at us.

Cries.

MR. ROONEY: Will they pelt us with mud to-day, do you suppose?

Cries.

 Let us turn and face them. (Cries. They turn. Silence.) Threaten them with your stick. (Silence.) They have run away.

Pause.

MR. ROONEY: Did you ever wish to kill a child? (Pause.) Nip some young doom in the bud. (Pause) Many a time at night, in winter, on the black road home, I nearly attacked the boy. (Pause.) Poor Jerry! (Pause.) What restrained me then? (Pause.) Not fear of man. (Pause.) Shall we go on backwards now a little?

 Backwards?

MR. ROONEY: Yes. Or you forwards and I backwards. The perfect pair. Like Dante's damned, 
 with their faces arsy-versy. Our tears will water our bottoms.

 What is the matter, Dan? Are you not well?

MR. ROONEY: Well! Did you ever know me to be well? The day you met me I should have been in bed. The day you proposed to me the doctors gave me up. You knew that, did you not? The night you married me they came for me with an ambulance. You have not forgotten that, I suppose? (Pause.) No, I cannot be said to be well. But I am no worse. Indeed I am better than I was. The loss of my sight was a great fillip. If I could go deaf and dumb I think I might pant on to be a hundred. Or have I done so? (Pause.) Was I a hundred to-day? (Pause.) Am I a hundred, Maddy?

Silence.

 All is still. No living soul in sight. There is no one to ask. The world is feeding. The wind--(brief wind)--scarcely stirs the leaves and the birds--(brief chirp)--are tired singing. The cows--(brief moo)--and sheep--(brief baa)--ruminate in silence. The dogs--(brief bark)--are hushed and the hens--(brief cackle)--sprawl torpid in the dust. We are alone. There is no one to ask.

Silence.

MR. ROONEY: (clearing his throat, narrative tone). We drew out on the tick of time, I can vouch for that. I was--

 How can you vouch for it?

MR. ROONEY: (normal tone, angrily). I can vouch for it, I tell you! Do you want my relation or don't you? (Pause. Narrative tone.) On the tick of time. I had the compartment to myself, as usual. At least I hope so, for I made no attempt to restrain myself. My mind--(Normal tone.) But why do we not sit down somewhere? Are we afraid we should never rise again?

 Sit down on what?

MR. ROONEY: On a bench, for example.

 There is no bench.

MR. ROONEY: Then on a bank, let us sink down upon a bank.

 There is no bank.

MR. ROONEY: Then we cannot. (Pause.) I dream of other roads, in other lands. Of another home, another--(he hesitates)--another home. (Pause.) What was I trying to say?

 Something about your mind.

MR. ROONEY: (startled). My mind? Are you sure. (Pause. Incredulous.) My mind? . . (Pause.) Ah yes. (Narrative tone.) Alone in the compartment my mind began to work, as so often after office hours, on the way home, in the train, to the lilt of the bogeys. Your season-ticket, I said, costs you twelve pounds a year and you earn, on an average, seven and six a day, that is to say barely enough to keep you alive and twitching with the help of food, drink, tobacco and periodicals until you finally reach home and fall into bed. Add to this--or subtract from it--rent, stationery, various subscriptions, tramfares to and fro, light and heat, permits and licences, hairtrims and shaves, tips to escorts, upkeep of premises and appearances, and a thousand unspecifiable sundries, and it is clear that by lying at home in bed, day and night, winter and summer, with a change of pyjamas once a fortnight, you would add very considerably to your income. Business, I said--(A cry. Pause. Again. Normal tone.) Did I hear a cry?

 Mrs. Tully, I fancy. Her poor husband is in constant pain and beats her unmercifully.

Silence.

MR. ROONEY: That was a short knock. (Pause.) What was I trying to get at?

 Business.

MR. ROONEY: Ah yes, business. (Narrative tone.) Business, old man, I said, retire from business, it has retired from you. (Normal tone.) One has these moments of lucidity.

 I feel very cold and weak.

MR. ROONEY: (narrative tone). On the other hand, I said, there are the horrors of home life, the dusting, sweeping, airing, scrubbing,  waxing, waning, washing, mangling, drying, mowing, clipping, raking, rolling, scuffling, shovelling, grinding, tearing, pounding, banging and slamming. And the brats, the happy little hearty little howling neighbours' brats. Of all this and much more the week-end, the Saturday intermission and then the day of rest, have given you some idea. But what must it be like on a working-day? A Wednesday? A Friday! What must it be like on a Friday! And I fell to thinking of my silent, backstreet, basement office, with its obliterated plate, rest-couch and velvet hangings, and what it means to be buried there alive, if only from ten to five, with convenient to the one hand a bottle of light pale ale and to the other a long ice-cold fillet of hake. Nothing, I said, not even fully certified death, can ever take the place of that. It was then I noticed we were at a standstill. (Pause. Normal tone. Irritably.) Why are you hanging out of me like that? Have you swooned away? I feel very cold and faint. The wind-- (whistling wind)--is whistling through my summer frock as if I had nothing on over my bloomers. I have had no solid food since my elevenses.

MR. ROONEY: You have ceased to care. I speak--and you listen to the wind.

 No no, I am agog, tell me all, then we shall press on and never pause, never pause, till we come safe to haven.

Pause.

MR. ROONEY: Never pause . . . safe to haven . . . Do you know, Maddy, sometimes one would think you were struggling with a dead language.

 Yes indeed, Dan, I know full well what you mean, I often have that feeling, it is unspeakably excruciating.

MR. ROONEY: I confess I have it sometimes myself, when I happen to overhear what I am saying.

 Well, you know, it will be dead in time, just like our own poor dear Gaelic, there is that to be said.

Urgent baa.

MR. ROONEY: (startled). Good God!

 Oh, the pretty little woolly lamb, crying to suck its mother! Theirs has not changed, since Arcady.Pause.MR. ROONEY: Where was I in my composition? At a standstill.MR. ROONEY: Ah yes. (clears his throat. Narrative tone.) I concluded naturally that we had entered a station and would soon be on our way again, and I sat on, without misgiving. Not a sound. Things are very dull to-day, I said, nobody getting down, nobody getting on. Then as time flew by and nothing happened I realized my error. We had not entered a station. Did you not spring up and poke your head out of the window?MR. ROONEY: What good would that have done me? Why to call out to be told what was amiss.MR. ROONEY: I did not care what was amiss. No, I just sat on, saying, If this train were never to move again I should not greatly mind.  Then gradually a--how shall I say--a growing desire to--er--you know--welled up within me. Nervous probably. In fact now I am sure. You know, the feeling of being confined. Yes yes, I have been through that.MR. ROONEY: If we sit here much longer, I said, I really do not know what I shall do. I got up and paced to and fro between the seats, like a caged beast. That is a help sometimes.MR. ROONEY: After what seemed an eternity we simply moved off. And the next thing was Barrell bawling the abhorred name. I got down and Jerry led me to the men's, or Fir as they call it now, from Vir Viris I suppose, the V becoming F, in accordance with Grimm's Law. (Pause.) The rest you know. (Pause.) You say nothing? (Pause.) Say something, Maddy. Say you believe me. I remember once attending a lecture by one of these new mind doctors, I forget what you call them. He spoke--

MR. ROONEY: A lunatic specialist?

 No no, just the troubled mind, I was hoping he might shed a little light on my lifelong preoccupation with horses' buttocks.

MR. ROONEY: A neurologist.

 No no, just mental distress, the name will come back to me in the night. I remember his telling us the story of a little girl, very strange and unhappy in her ways, and how he treated her unsuccessfully over a period of years and was finally obliged to give up the case. He could find nothing wrong with her, he said. The only thing wrong with her as far as he could see was that she was dying. And she did in fact die, shortly after he washed his hands of her.

MR. ROONEY: Well? What is there so wonderful about that?

 No, it was just something he said, and the way he said it, that have haunted me ever since.

MR. ROONEY: You lie awake at night, tossing to and fro and brooding on it.

 On it and other . . . wretchedness. (Pause.) When he had done with the little girl he stood there motionless for some time, quite two minutes I should say, looking down at his table. Then he suddenly raised his head and exclaimed, as if he bad had a revelation, The trouble with her was she had never been really born! (Pause.) He spoke throughout without notes. (Pause.) I left before the end.

MR. ROONEY: Nothing about your buttocks? (Mrs. Rooney weeps. In affectionate remonstrance.) Maddy!

 There is nothing to be done for those people!

MR. ROONEY: For which is there? (Pause.) That does not sound right somehow. (Pause.) What way am I facing?

 What?

MR. ROONEY: I have forgotten what way I am facing.

 You have turned aside and are bowed down over the ditch.

MR. ROONEY: There is a dead dog down there.

 No no, just the rotting leaves.

MR. ROONEY: In June? Rotting leaves in June?

 Yes dear, from last year, and from the year before last, and from the year before that again. (Silence. Rainy wind. They move on. Dragging steps, etc.) There is that lovely laburnum again. Poor thing, it is losing all its tassels. (Dragging steps, etc.) There are the first drops. (Rain. Dragging feet, etc.) Golden drizzle. (Dragging steps, etc.) Do not mind me, dear, I am just talking to myself. (Rain heavier. Dragging steps, etc.) Can hinnies procreate, I wonder.

They halt, on Mr. Rooney's initiative.

MR. ROONEY: Say that again.

 Come on, dear, don't mind me, we are getting drenched.

MR. ROONEY: (forcibly). Can what what?

 Hinnies procreate. (Silence.) You know,

MR. ROONEY: No.

 Then why do you stop?

MR. ROONEY: It is easier.

 Are you very wet?

MR. ROONEY: To the buff.

 The buff?

MR. ROONEY: The buff. From buffalo.

 We shall hang up all our things in the hotcupboard and get into our dressing-gowns. (Pause.) Put your arm round me. (Pause.) Be nice to me! (Pause. Gratefully.) Ah Dan! (They move on. Wind and rain. Dragging feet, etc. Faintly same music as before. They halt. Music clearer. Silence but for music playing. Music dies.) All day the same old record. All alone in that great empty house. She must be a very old woman now.

MR. ROONEY: (indistinctly). Death and the Maiden.

Silence.

 You are crying. (Pause.) Are you crying?

MR. ROONEY: (violently). Yes! (They move on. Wind

and rain. Dragging feet, etc. They halt. They move on. Wind and rain. Dragging feet, etc. They halt.) Who is the preacher to-morrow? The incumbent?

 No.

MR. ROONEY: Thank God for that. Who?

 Hardy.

MR. ROONEY: "How to be Happy though Married"?

 No no, he died, you remember. No connexion.

MR. ROONEY: Has he announced the text?

 "The Lord upholdeth all that fall and raiseth up all those that be bowed down." (Silence. They join in wild laughter. They move on. Wind and rain. Dragging feet, etc.) Hold me tighter, Dan! (Pause.) Oh yes!

They halt.

MR. ROONEY: I hear something behind us.

Pause.

 It looks like Jerry. (Pause.) It is Jerry.

Sound of Jerry's running steps approach-

JERRY: (panting). You dropped something, Sir, Mr. Barrell told me to run after you.

JERRY: Yes, Ma'am.

MR. ROONEY: If I am alive.

JERRY: Yessir.

Jerry starts running back towards the station.

 Jerry! ( Jerry halts.) Did you hear what the hitch was? (Pause.) Did you hear what kept the train so late?

MR. ROONEY: How would he have heard? Come on.

 What was it, Jerry?

JERRY: It was a--

MR. ROONEY: Leave the boy alone, he knows nothing! Come on!

 What was it, Jerry?

JERRY: It was a little child, Ma'am.

Mr. Rooney groans.

 What do you mean, it was a little child?

JERRY: It was a little child fell out of the carriage, On to the line, Ma'am. (Pause.) Under the wheels, Ma'am.

Silence. Jerry runs off. His steps die away. Tempest of wind and rain. It abates. They move on. Dragging steps, etc. They halt. Tempest of wind and rain.
