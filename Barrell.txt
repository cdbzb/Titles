Not long enough 
Mr. Barrell  
Would I were still in bed, 
Mr. Barrell.  
Would I were lying 
stretched out in my 
comfortable 
bed, Mr. Barrell, 
just wasting 
slowly 
painlessly 
away 
keeping up my strength 
with arrowroot and 
calves-foot jelly, 
till in the end 
you wouldn't see me 
under the blankets any 
more than a board.  
Oh no coughing 
or spitting 
or bleeding 
or vomiting, 
just drifting 
gently 
down into the higher 
life, and 
remembering, 
remembering 
all the silly un-
happiness 
as thoughi
t had never happened
what did I do with that 
handkerchief?  
How long have you been 
master of this station now, 
Mr. Barrell?
Don't ask me, Mrs. Rooney, don't ask me.
You stepped into your father's shoes, I believe, when he took them off.
Poor Pappy!  He didn't live long to enjoy his ease.
I remember him clearly. 
A small ferrety purple-faced widower, 
deaf as a doornail, very 
testy and snappy.  
I suppose... 
you'll be re-
tiring soon yourself,
Mr. Barrell, and 
growing your roses.  
Did I understand you to say 
the twelve thirty would soon be upon us?
Those were my words.
But according to my 
watch, which is 
more or less right
--or was--
according to the
eight o'clock news,
 the time 
is now 
coming up to twelve . . . 
thirty-six.  And yet 
upon the other hand 
the up mail has 
not yet gone 
through.  
Or has it sped 
by me unbeknown to me?  
For there was a time there, 
I remember now, I 
was so plunged in 
sorrow I 
wouldn't have 
heard a 
steam roller go 
over me.  
Don't go, Mr. Barrell! 
 Mr. Barrell! 

 Mr. Barrell!

What is it, Mrs. Rooney, 

I have my work to do.

The wind is getting up.  
The best of the day is over.  
Soon the rain 
will begin to fall 
and go on falling, 
all afternoon.  
Then at evening 
the clouds 
will part, 
the setting sun 
will shine 
an instant, 
then sink, behind the hills. 
 Mr. Barrell! 
Mr. Barrell!  

I estrange them all. 
They come towards me, 
uninvited, 
bygones bygones, 
full of kindness, 
anxious to help
genuinely pleased
to see me again
looking so well
A few simple words
from my heart
and I am all alone
once more
