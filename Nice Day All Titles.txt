 
Poor woman
All alone in that ruinous old house
  
Is that you Christy?
It is Ma'am
I thought the hinny was familiar
How is your poor mother?
No better Ma'am
Your daughter then?
No worse Ma'am
Why do you halt? 
But why do I halt?
 
Nice day for the races
Perhaps it is
But will it hold up? 
Will it hold up?
I suppose you wouldn't be in need
Hist! 
Surely to goodness that couldn't be the 
 
up mail I hear already?
Damn the mail
Oh thank God for that!
I could have sworn I heard it
thundering down the track 
in the far distance
I suppose you wouldn't be in need 
of a small load of 
dung?
Dung? 
What class of dung?
Stydung
Stydung 
I like your frankness Christy
I'll ask the master Christy
 
Yes Ma'am
 
Do you find anything
bizarre about my way of speaking? 
 
I do not mean the voice 
No I mean the words
I use none but the 
simplest words 
I think
and yet 
I 
sometimes 
find 
my 
way of speaking very
 
bizarre 
Mercy! - What was that?
Never mind her Ma'am 
she's very fresh in herself today
Dung? What would we want with dung 
at our time of life? 
Why are you on your feet 
down on the road?
Why do you not climb up on the 
crest of your manure 
and let yourself be carried away? 
Is it that you have no head for heights?
Wiyya ta hell out of that!
 
She doesn't move a muscle
I too should be getting along 
if I do not wish to arrive 
late at the station
But a moment ago she 
neighed and pawed the ground
And now she refuses to advance 
Give her a good welt on the rump
 
Harder! 
 
Well! If someone were to do that for me 
I wouldn't dally
How she gazes at me to be sure with her 
great 
moist 
leg-tormented 
eyes! 
Perhaps 
if I were to move on
down the road
out of her field of vision 
 
No no enough! 
Take her by the snaffle and 
take her eyes away from me.
Oh this is awful 
 
What have I done to deserve all this
what what? 
So long ago 
No! No! 
"Sigh out a something something 
tale of things 
Done long ago
and ill done." 
How can I go on I cannot
Oh let me just flop down 
flat on the road like a 
big fat jelly out of a bowl and 
never move 
again! 
A great big slop 
thick with grit and dust and flies
they would have to 
scoop me up with a shovel
 
Heavens there is that 
 
up mail again
 
what will become of me! 
 
Oh I am just a 
hysterical old hag I know 
destroyed with sorrow and 
pining and gentility and 
church-going and fat and rheumatism 
and childlessness 
 
Minnie! 
Little Minnie! 
Love love is all I asked
a little love daily
 
twice daily
fifty years 
of twice daily love 
like a Paris horsebutcher's regular 
what normal woman wants affection?
A kiss in the evening near the ear 
and another at morning
peck peck
till you grow whiskers on you
 
There is that lovely laburnum again
 
 
 
Pardon me if I 
do not doff my cap
I'd fall off
Divine day for the meeting
Oh Mr. Tyler
you startled the life out of me 
sneaking up beside me like that 
like a deer-stalker! 
Oh!
I rang my bell Mrs. Rooney 
the moment I spotted you 
I started tinkling my bell 
now don't you deny it
Your bell is one thing
and you are another
What news of your daughter?
 
fair 
 
fair 
 
they removed 
everything 
the whole 
er 
bag of tricks 
Now I am 
grandchild-less
 
Gracious how you wobble! 
Dismount for mercy's sake 
or ride on
Perhaps 
if I 
were 
to place
my 
hand 
gently
on your shoulder
Mrs. Rooney
how would that be? 
Would you permit that?
No Mr. Rooney
Mr. Tyler I mean
 
I am tired 
of light old 
hands on my shoulders 
and other useless places 
sick and tired of them
Heavens
here comes Connolly's van! 
 
 
Are you all right Mr. Tyler? 
Where is he? 
 
Aah 
there you are! 
 
That was a narrow scrape
 
I alit in the nick of time
It is suicide to be abroad 
But what is it to be at home?
A lingering dissolution
Now we are white with dust 
from head to foot
I beg your pardon?
 
Nothing Mrs. Rooney 
nothing 
I was only
cursing 
under my breath
God and man
under my breath 
and the wet 
Saturday afternoon of my 
conception
My back 
tire has gone out again
I pumped it 
hard as iron 
before I went out
And now 
I am on the rim
Oh what a shame!
Now if it were the front 
I would not so much mind
But the back
The back! 
The chain! 
The grease! 
The brakes! 
The gear! 
No! It is too much!
 
Are we 
already late? 
I have not the 
courage to 
look at my watch
Late! 
I on my bicycle 
as I rolled along was
already 
late 
now therefore we are 
doubly 
late 
trebly 
quadrupedly late 
would I had shot by you 
without a word
 
Who are you 
 
going to meet?
Hardy 
We used to climb together 
I saved his life once 
I have not forgotten it
 
Let us a halt a moment and this 
vile dust 
fall back upon the 
viler worms
 
What sky! 
What light! 
 
Ah in spite of all 
it is a blessed thing 
to be alive in such weather 
and out of hospital
Alive?
Well half alive shall we say?
Speak for yourself
I am not half alive 
nor anything approaching it 
What are we standing here for? 
This dust will not settle 
in our time 
and when it does some 
great 
whirring 
machine will 
come and blow it all 
sky high again
Well shall we be getting along 
in that case?
No
Come Mrs. Rooney
Go Mr. Tyler
go on and leave me
listening to the cooing of 
the ringdoves 
 
 
If you see 
my old blind Dan 
tell him I was 
on my way to meet him
when it all came 
over me again
like a flood 
Say to him
Your poor wife 
she told 
me to tell you it all came 
flooding over her 
again and she 
simply went back 
home 
 
straight 
back 
home 
 
Come 
Mrs. Rooney 
come 
the mail has not yet gone up 
just take my free arm 
and we'll be there 
with time and to spare
 
What?
What's all this now? 
Can't you see Im in trouble? 
Have you no respect for misery? 
Minnie! 
Little Minnie!
Come 
Mrs. Rooney 
come 
the mail has not yet gone up 
just take my free arm 
and we'll be there 
with time and to 
spare...
 
Mrs Rooney 
About forty now she'd be 
 
I don't know
fifty 
 
girding up her 
lovely little loins 
getting ready for 
the change
 
for the change
 
Will you get along with you 
Mr. Rooney 
Mr. Tyler I mean 
will you get along with you now 
and cease molesting me? 
 
What kind of a country 
is this where a 
woman can't 
cry her eyes out in the 
highways and byways 
without being molested 
by retired 
bill-brokers! 
 
Heavens 
you're not 
going to ride her flat! 
You'll tear your tube to ribbons! 
 
 
Venus birds! 
Cooing in the night
all the long 
summer long 
 
Oh cursed corset! 
 
If I could only 
let it out 
without indecent exposure 
Mr. Tyler! 
Mr. Tyler! 
Come back and unlace me 
behind the hedge! 
What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with me?
never tranquil 
seething out of my 
dirty old pelt 
out of my skull!
Oh to be in atoms 
in atoms! 
ATOMS!
 
 
Jesus!
  
Jesus!
 
 
 
 
 
Is anything 
wrong Mrs. Rooney? 
You are bent all double 
Have you a pain in your stomach? 
Ha Ha Ha 
Well if it isn't 
my old admirer 
the Clerk of the Course 
in his limousine
 
May I offer you a 
lift Mrs. Rooney? 
Are you going in 
my direction?
I am 
we all are 
How is your poor mother?
 
Thank you 
she is fairly comfortable 
We manage 
to keep her 
out of pain 
That is the great thing 
Mrs. Rooney 
is it not?
Yes indeed Mr. Slocum 
that is the great thing 
I don't know how you do it 
Ah these wasps!
May I then offer you 
a lift Madam?
Oh that would be 
heavenly 
Mr. Slocum 
simply heavenly 
But can I ever get up?
you look very 
high off the 
ground to-day 
these new balloon 
tires I suppose
Does this roof
never come off? 
No? 
 
No
 
I'll never do it
you'll have to get down 
Mr. Slocum 
and help me from 
the rear 
What was that? 
This is all 
your suggestion Sir
drive on drive on
I'm coming Mrs. Rooney 
I'm coming give me time 
I'm as stiff as yourself
Stiff! 
Well I like that! 
And me heaving all over 
back and front 
The dry old reprobate!
Now 
how shall we do this?
As if I were a bale
don't be afraid 
That's the way! 
 
Lower! 
 
Wait! 
No don't let go! 
Suppose I do get up 
will I ever get down?
You'll get down
Mrs. Rooney
you'll get down
We may not get you up
but I warrant you
you'll get you down
Oh! 
 
Lower! 
 
Don't be afraid! 
We're past the age when
There!
Now
Get your shoulder under it
Oh
Oh
Oh mercy
Up Up
AAM
I'm in
My frock
You've nipped my frock
My nice frock
Look what you've done to
my nice frock
 
 
What will Dan say
when he sees me?
Has he then
recovered his sight?
No
I mean when he knows
what will he say when he
 
feels the hole? 
 
What are you doing Mr. Slocum?
 
Gazing straight before me
through the windshield
 
out at the void
 
Start her up I beseech you
and let us be off
This is awful!
Last Sunday she
ran like a
dream
and now she is
dead
That is what you get
for a good deed
Perhaps if I were to choke her 
 
She was getting too much air!
 
Mind the hen!
 
Oh mother you have squashed her 
drive on drive on!
What a death!
 
One minute picking happy at the dung
in the road in the sun
with now and then a dust bath
and then
--bang!--
all her troubles over
all the hatching and the laying
Just one great squawk and then
peace
 
They would have
slit her weasand
in any case
Here we are
let me out
What are you up to now
Mr. Slocum?
We are at a standstill
all danger is past
and you blow your horn
Now if instead of
blowing it now
you had blown it at that
unfortunate--
 
Will you come here
Tommy
and help this lady out 
she's stuck
Open the door
and ease her out
Certainly Sir
Nice day for the races
 
Who do you fancy
Don't mind me
Don't take any notice of me
I do not exist
The fact is
well known
Do as you're told Tommy
for goodness sake
Yessir
now Ms. Rooney
wait! Tommy wait!
don't bustle me
let me just wheel round 
and get my feet to the ground
 
now
 
watch your feather Ma'am
easy now 
easy
Wait for god's sake
You'll have me beheaded
Crouch
down Ms. Rooney
crouch down and 
get your head into the open
Crouch down at my time of life
this is lunacy
press her down
 
 
merde 
now
she's coming
straighten up now
there 
am I in? 
Tommy?
Tommy?
where the hell are you?
you wouldn't have something for the Ladies' plate sir?
I was given Flash Harry
Flash Harry
that carthorse
Tommy
Blast your bleeding bloody
oh Ms. Rooney
 
who was that crucifying his gear box Tommy
Old Cissy Slocum
Cissy Slocum
That's a nice way to refer to your elders
Cissy Slocum and you an orphan 
What are you doing stravaging 
down here on the public road?
This is no place for you at all 
Get up here on the platform now 
and whip out the truck
nice to see you up and about 
again you were laid up there a long time
not long enough Mr. barrell
would I were still in bed Mr. Barrell
 
would I were still laid up 
in my comfortable bed Mr. Barrell
Just wasting
slowly
painlessly
away
keeping up my strength 
with arrowroot and calf's foot jelly
till in the end 
you couldn't see me under the covers any
more than a board 
oh no coughing
 
or spitting
or bleeding 
or sweating or vomiting 
just drifting 
slowly 
down into the higher light 
and remembering
remembering all the 
silly unhappiness as though
 
it had never happened
 
How long have you been 
master of this station now Mr. Barrell?
don't ask me Ms. Rooney 
don't ask me
You stepped into your father's shoes 
I suppose when he took them off
Poor pappy
He didn't live long
to enjoy his rest
I remember him clearly
a small
ferrety purple faced widower
deaf as a doornail
very
testy and snappy
 
I suppose
You'll be retiring soon yourself
Mr. Barrell and growing your roses
did I understand you to say
the twelve thirty will soon be upon us?
this were my words
but according to my watch 
which is more or less right
or was according to the
  
eight o clock news
the time is now
getting up to twelve
thirty six
and yet upon the other
hand the up mail has not yet gone through
or has it slipped by me 
unbeknownst to me 
for there was a time there I remember it 
now
I was so plunged in sorrow
I wouldn't have heard 
a steamroller go over me 
 
don't go Mr. Barrell
Mr. Barrell
Mr. Barrell
What is it Ma'am?
I have my work to do
 
 
the wind is getting up
 
the best of the day is over 
soon the rain
will begin to fall
and go on falling
all afternoon
 
 
then at evening
 
the clouds
will part
 
the setting sun will shine a moment and 
sink behind the trees
Mr. Barrell
Mr. Barrell
Mr. Barrell!
I estrange them all
They come towards you
uninvited
bygones bygones
full of kindness genuinely pleased 
to see you again looking so well 
a few simple words from my heart and 
I am all alone once more 
 
Ms Fitt
am I then invisible Ms. Fitt
Is this cretonne so becoming to me 
that I merge into the masonry?
that's right
Look closely
and you will finally distinguish 
a once female form
Ms. Rooney
I saw you but I didn't know you
Last Sunday we worshipped together
We knelt side by side at the same altar
drank from the same chalice
have I so changed since then
oh but in church Ms. Rooney
in church I am alone with my maker
are not you?
why even the pastor himself you know
when he takes up the collection knows
that it's useless to pause before me
I simply do not see the plate 
or bag or whatever
it is they use
how could I?
Why even when all is over 
and I go out in to the sweet fresh air 
why even then 
for the first hour or so
I stumble in a kind of daze 
as you might say 
oblivious to my core
ligionists and they are very 
kind I must admit 
the vast majority very 
kind and understanding 
they know me now and take no umbrage
there she goes 
they say 
there goes The Dark Miss Fitt 
alone with her maker
take no notice of her 
and they step down off the path
to avoid my running in to them
Ah yes I am distrait
very distrait 
even on weekdays 
ask my mother if you do not believe me
'Hettie' 
she says when I start eating my doily 
instead of the thin bread and butter
'Hettie' how can you be so distrait?
I believe the truth is 
I'm just not there Ms. Rooney
just not really there at all
I eat drink sleep 
I go through the usual motions but my
heart isn't in it 
but heart
is in none of it
left to myself 
with no one to stop me 
I would soon be flown
 
home
so if you think I
cut you just now Ms. Rooney 
you do me an injustice
All I see is a big red blur
Just another big red blur
Is something amiss Ms. Rooney
you don't seem normal somehow
so bowed and bent?
Maddy Rooney nee Dunne
the big red blur 
you have piercing sight Ms. Fitt 
literally piercing
  
well
is there anything I can do 
now that I'm here?
If you could help me up 
the face of this cliff 
I have little doubt 
your maker would requite you
if no one else
Now now Ms. Rooney
don't put your teeth into me
requite
I make these sacrifices for nothing 
or not at all
 
I take it you want to lean on me?
 
I asked Mr. Barrell to give me his arm
just give me his arm
he turned on his heels and strode away
Is it my arm you want then?
Is it my arm you want?
or what is it?
Your arm
 
any arm
a helping hand 
for one moment
Christ what a planet
really
do you know what it is Ms. Rooney
I don't think it is wise of you 
to be going about at all
come down here Ms. Fitt
and give me your arm 
before I scream down the whole county
 
Well I suppose it is 
the protestant thing to do
 
Pismires do it
for one another
 
I have seen slugs do it
 
 
no the other side if its
just the same to you
I'm left handed on top of
everything else
 
 
heavens child
 
you're just a bag of bones
you need building up
 
this is worse than the Matterhorn
have you ever been up the Matterhorn?
great honeymoon resort
 
 
why don't they have a handrail?
 
 
wait
 
till I
 
catch my breath
don't drop me
 
 
then encircling 
gloom
turn
turn me on
the night is dark and I am 
far from home
tum tum
stop it Ms. Rooney
Stop it, or I'll drop you
 
A little later, on the platform 
 
 
Thank you Ms. Fitt
thank you
 
that will do
just prop me
up against the wall 
like a load of tarpaulin 
and that will be all for the moment 
I am sorry for 
all this ramdam Ms. Fitt
had I known you were 
looking for your mother
I should not have opportuned you
I know what it is 
Ramdam
come Dolly darling
let us take up our stand before the
first class smokers
take my hand
and hold me tight
you can be pulled under
you have lost your mother Ms. Fitt?
Good morning Mr. Tyler
Good morning Ms. Fitt
Good morning Ms. Fitt
Good morning Mr. Barrell
 
you have lost your mother Ms. Fitt
she said she would be on the 
last train
do not imagine because I am silent
that I am not present and a live to 
all that is going on
When you say the last train
do not flatter yourself
for one moment
because I hold aloof that my 
sufferings have ceased 
 
no
 
the entire scene 
the hills
the plain
the racecourse 
with its miles and miles of
white fence and
three red stands
 
the pretty little wayside station
even you yourself yes
I mean it and over all the clouding blue
I see it all
I stand here and see it all with the eyes 
though eyes
Oh if you had my eyes
you would understand 
the things they have seen 
and not looked away
this is
 
nothing
 
nothing
where did I put that handkerchief?
when you say they last train
 
when you say the last train
I take it you mean the twelve thirty
what else would I mean?
what else could I conceivably mean?
then you have no cause 
for anxiety Ms. Fitt
for the twelve thirty has not yet arrived
there
 
no up the line
 
no Ms. Fitt
follow the direction of my finger
 
there you see it 
the signal at the 
bawdy hour of nine
or three alas
 
  
thank you Mr. Barrell
but the time is now
getting on to 
we all know Ms. Fitt
we all know only too well
what the time is now
getting on to 
and yet the cruel fact remains
the twelve thirty 
has not yet arrived
not an accident I trust?
do not tell me it has left the track
Darling Mother 
with the cold fish for lunch
 
that's enough guff out of you
nip up on the platform now
and see has Mr. Clark
anything for us
Poor Dan!
What terrible thing has happened 
now now Ms. Fitt do
Poor Dan!
now now Ms. Fitt do not 
give way to despair
all will come right in the end 
what is the situation Mr. Barrell 
not a collision surely 
a collision that would be wonderful
a collision
I knew it
Come Ms. Fitt 
let us move a little up the platform
yes let us all do that
no?
you have changed your mind?
 
I agree we are better here 
in the shadow of the waiting room
 
Excuse me a mo—
before you slink away Mr. Barrell
please a statement of some kind
I insist
even the slowest train on this brief line 
is not ten minutes and
more behind its scheduled time
without good cause on imagines
 
We all know your station is the
best run on the entire line
but there are times when
 
that is just not enough
just not enough!
here we are eating our hearts out 
with anxiety for our loved ones
and he calls it a hitch!
some of us like myself
with heart and kidney trouble
might collapse
at any moment 
and he calls it a hitch!
In our ovens 
the Saturday roast is 
burning to a shrivel
and he
Here comes Tommy running
I am glad I have been spared
to see this
 
she's coming
 
she's at the level crossing
 
 
the up train!
 
the up train!
 
Dan!
are you alright? 
where is he?
 
Dan!
have you seen my husband?
 
Dan!
 
he isn't on it 
the misery I have endured to get here
and he isn't on it
Mr. Barrell
 
was he not on it?
 
Is anything the matter?
 
you look as if you had seen a ghost
Tommy have you seen the master?
He'll be along Ma'am
Jerry is watching him
 
Oh Dan there you are 
 
Where in the world were you?
Maddy
Where were you all this time?
In the men's
Kiss me!
Kiss you? 
In the station?
On the platform? 
Before the boy? 
Have you taken leave of your senses?
Jerry wouldn't mind Would you Jerry?
No Ma'am
What news of your father?
They took him away
Then you are all alone?
Yes Ma'am
Why are you here? 
You did not notify me
I wanted to give you 
a surprise for your birthday
My birthday?
Have you not forgotten it?
I wished you your happy returns 
in the bathroom
I did not hear you
But I gave you a tie 
You have it on!
What age am I now?
Now never mind about that 
Come!
Why did you not cancel the boy? 
Now we shall have to give him a penny
I forgot
I had such a time getting here
Such horrid nasty people
 
Be nice to me Dan
Be nice to me today 
 
Give the boy a penny
Here are two halfpennies Jerry 
Buy yourself a nice gobstopper
Yes Ma'am
Come for me on Wednesday 
if I am still alive
Yessir
 
We could have saved sixpence
We have saved fivepence
But at what price?
 
Are you not well?
Once and for all do not ask me to 
move and speak at the same time
I shall not say this in this life again
 
Are you not—
Let me get this precipice over
Put your arms around me
Have you been drinking again? 
You are quivering like a blanc-mange!
Are you in a condition to lead me?
You shall fall into the ditch!
Oh Dan It will be like old times!
Pull yourself together 
or I shall send Tommy for the cab
Then instead of having saved sixpence
no fivepence 
we would have saved 
two and three less 
six one and no 
plus one one and no 
plus three 
one and nine and one 
ten and three 
 
two and one 
 
two and one 
we shall be the poorer 
to the tune of two and one 
Damn that sun it has gone in 
What is the day doing?
 
Shrouding
 
Shrouding 
 
The best of it has gone
Soon the first great drops will fall 
Splashing in the dust
 
And yet the glass was full
Let us 
hasten home 
and sit before the fire
We will draw the blinds
You will read to me
I think Effie 
is going to commit adultery 
with the Major
 
Wait
I have been up and down these stairs 
ten thousand times 
and still I do not know
how many there are!
When I think there are six 
there are four or five 
or seven 
or eight 
and when I remember 
there are five 
there are three or four 
or seven or six and 
when finally I realize there are seven 
there are five or six 
or eight or nine!
Sometimes I wonder if they do not 
change them in the night
Well? 
How many do you make them to be?

Do not ask me to count not now. 
Not count ?
One of the few great pleasures in life
Not steps Dan please! 
I always get them wrong
Then you might fall on your wound and
I would have that on my manure-heap 
on top of everything else
No
just cling to me and all will be well
Well?
That is what she calls well
We are down 
And little the worse
 
Do you know what it is? 
I think I will retire
Retire 
And stay at home
On your grant?
Never tread these cursed steps again 
Trudge this hellish stairs for the last time
Stay at home on the remnants 
of my bottom 
counting the days till the next meal
The very thought puts life in me
Hurry before it dies!
 
Now mind here is the path
 
Up! 
 
Well done!
 
Now we are in safety 
and a straight run home
A straight run!
 
She calls 
that 
a straight run!
 
Hush! do not speak as you go along
you know it is not good for your coronary
Just concentrate on putting 
one foot before the next 
or whatever the expression is
 
That's the way
 
Now we are doing nicely 
 
Heavens!
I knew there was something
With all the excitement
I forgot
Good God
But you must know Dan 
of course you were on it 
What ever happened?
Tell me?
I have never known anything to happen
But you must—
All this starting and stopping 
again is devilish
devilish
You get a little way on me 
and begin to be carried 
along 
when suddenly you stop short 
Two hundred pounds of unhealthy flesh
What possessed you to come out at all
Let go of me!
No I must know!
We won't leave until you tell me!
Thirty minutes late?
On a fifteen minute run?
It's unheard of!
I know nothing 
Let go of me before I shake you off!
But you must know 
You were on it
Was it at the terminus? 
Did you leave on time? 
Or was it on the line?
Did something happen on the line?
Dan!
Why won't you tell me?
 
 
What was that?
 
The Lynch twins jeering at us
 
Will they pelt us with mud to-day 
do you suppose?
 
Let us turn and face them
 
Threaten them with your stick
 
They have run away
 
Did you ever wish to kill a child? 
Nip some young doom in the bud
Many a time at night 
in winter on the black road home 
I nearly attacked the boy
Poor Jerry 
What restrained me then? 
Not fear of man
 
Shall we go on backwards now a little?
Backwards?
 
Yes 
Or you forwards and I backwards 
The perfect pair 
Like Dante's damned 
with their faces arsy-versy
Our tears will water our bottoms
 
What is the matter Dan? Are you not well?
 
Well
Have you ever known me to be well?
The day you met me 
I should have been in bed
The day you proposed to me
the doctors gave me up 
You knew that did you not? 
The night you married me 
they came for me with an ambulance
You have not forgotten that I suppose?
No I cannot be said to be well 
But I am no worse
In fact I am better than I was 
The loss of my sight was a great fillip
If I could go deaf and dumb 
I might pant on to be a hundred 
Or have I done so? 
Am I a hundred to-day? 
Am I a hundred Maddy?
 
All is still
 
No living soul in sight
There is no one to ask 
The world is 
 
feeding
 
The wind
barely moves
the leaves and the birds
are tired singing
The cows
and sheep
ruminate in silence
The dogs are hushed 
and the hens
sprawl 
torpid in the dust
We are alone
There is no one to ask
 
We set out on the tick of time 
I can vouch for that 
How can you vouch for it?
I can vouch for it I tell you! 
Do you want my relation or don't you? 
On the tick of time
I had the compartment to myself 
At least I thought I did
for I made no attempt to restrain myself
My mind—
But why did we not sit down somewhere? 
Are we afraid we shall never rise again?
Sit down on what?
On a bench for example
There is no bench
On a bank let us sink down on a bank
There is no bank
Then we cannot
I dream of other roads
in other lands
Of another home
another-
-another home
What was I talking about?
Something about your mind
My mind? 
Are you sure
My mind? 
Ah yes
 
Alone in the compartment 
my mind began to work
as so often after office hours 
on the way home
on the train 
to the lilt of the bogeys
 
Your season-ticket I said
costs you eight pounds a year 
and you earn on an average 
seven and ten a week 
which is to say barely enough 
to keep you alive 
and twitching with the help 
of food
drink
tobacco 
and periodicals 
until I finally reach home 
and fall into bed
Add to that--or subtract from it--
rent
stationery
various subscriptions
tramways to and fro
light and heat 
permits and licences 
haircuts and shaves
tips to escorts
upkeep of premises and appearances
and a thousand unspecifiable sundries 
and it is clear 
that by lying at home in bed 
day and night 
winter and summer with a 
change of pyjamas 
once a fortnight you will add 
very considerably to your income 
Business I said—
 
Did I hear a cry?
Mrs. Tully I fancy
Her poor husband is in constant pain 
and beats her unmercifully
That was a short knock
What was I trying to get at?
Business
Ah yes
Business old man 
I said retire from business
It has retired from you 
One has these moments of lucidity
I feel very cold and weak
On the other hand I said
there are the 
horrors of home life 
the dusting 
sweeping 
airing
scraping 
waxing
waning 
washing 
mangling 
drying
mowing 
clipping 
raking
rolling 
scuffling 
shoveling
grinding 
tearing 
pounding 
banging and slamming
And the brats
the happy little hearty little 
howling neighbours' brats
Of all this and much more the 
week-end has given me 
some idea
But what must it be like 
on a working-day? 
A Wednesday? 
A Friday?
What must it be like on a Friday?
 
And I started thinking of my 
 
silent
backstreet 
basement office
with its obliterated plate 
rest-couch and velvet curtains
and what it means to be buried there 
 
alive
if only from nine to five
with convenient to the one hand 
a bottle of light pale ale 
and to the other 
a long ice-cold fillet of hake
 
Nothing 
not even fully certified death
can take the place of that
It was then I noticed 
we were at a standstill 
 
Why are you hanging out of me like that?
Have you swooned away?
I feel very cold and faint
The wind
is whistling through my summer frock 
as if I had 
nothing on over my bloomers
I have had no solid food 
since my elevenses
You have ceased to care!
I speak and you listen to the wind
 
Where was I in my composition?
At a standstill
Ah yes
I concluded naturally 
that we had entered a station 
and would soon be on our way again
and I sat on without misgiving
 
Not a sound 
nobody getting up nobody getting off 
Then as time goes by
and nothing happens 
I realize my error
We had not entered a station!
Did you not spring up 
and poke your head out of the window?
What good would that do me?
Why to be told what was amiss
I did not care what was amiss
No I just sat on thinking 
If this train were never to move again 
I would not greatly mind
Then gradually 
a- how you say
growing desire to 
er- you know-
welled up inside me 
Nervous probably 
You know the feeling of being confined
Yes yes I have been through that
 
If we sit here much longer I said 
I really do not know what I shall do 
 
After what seemed an eternity 
we simply moved off
And the next thing was 
Barrell bawling the abhorred name
I got down and Jerry led me to the Men's
 
Say something Maddy. 
 
I remember 
once attending a lecture by 
one of these new mind doctors 
I forget what you call them 
A Neurologist? 
No no just the troubled mind 
I was hoping he might 
shed a little light on my
 
lifelong preoccupation 
with horses' buttocks.
A Psychologist?
 
No no just mental distress
the name will come back to me 
in the night 
I remember his telling us the story 
of a little girl very strange and 
unhappy in her ways
and how he treated her unsuccessfully 
over a period of years 
and was finally obliged 
to give up the case
He could find nothing wrong with her 
he said 
The only thing wrong with her 
as far as he could see was 
that she was dying
And she did in fact die 
just as soon as 
he had washed his hands of her 
Well? 
What is there so wonderful about that?
No it was just something he said
and the way he said it 
that have haunted me ever since
 
He had done with the little girl 
he stood there motionless for some time 
quite two minutes I should say
looking down at his table
Then he suddenly
raised his head and exclaimed
as if he bad had a revelation 
 
The trouble with her was 
she had never really been born!
Nothing about your buttocks? 
 
 
Maddy!
There is nothing to be done 
with these people
For which is there
that does not sound right somehow
Which way am I facing?
What?
I have forgotten which way I am facing
You have turned away 
and are bowed down over the ditch
There is a dead dog in there
No no just the rotting leaves
In June? 
Rotting leaves in June?
Yes dear
from last year
and the year before that 
and the year before that again
 
There is that lovely laburnum again 
Poor thing she is losing all her tassels
 
There are the first drops
 
Golden drizzle
 
I am just thinking to myself
 
Do hinnies procreate I wonder
Say that again
Come on dear don't mind me 
we are getting soaked
Do what what?
Hinnies procreate 
You know
No
Then why do you halt?
It is easier
Are you very wet?
To the buff
The buff?
The buff 
From buffalo
Let us put up all our things 
in the hot cupboard
and get in to our dressing-gowns
Put your arm round me
Be nice to me!
Ah Dan!
 
All day the same old record. 
All alone in that great empty house
She must be a very old woman now
 
Death and the Maiden
Are you crying?
Are you crying?
Yes! 
 
 
Who is the preacher to-morrow? 
The incumbent?
No
Thank God for that 
Who?
Hardy
"How to be Happy though Married"?
No no he died you remember 
No relation
Has he announced the text?
 
"The Lord upholdeth all that fall 
and raiseth up all
those that be bowed down" 
 
 
I hear someone behind us
It looks like Jerry
It is Jerry
 
You dropped—
Take your time my little man 
you will burst a bloodvessel
You dropped something Sir
Mr. Barrell told me to come after you
Show
What is it? 
What is this thing Dan?
Perhaps it is not mine at all
Mr. Barrell said it is Sir
It looks like a kind of ball 
and yet it is not a ball
It is a thing I carry about with me
Yes but what—
It is a thing I carry about with me
I have no small money have you?
I have none of any kind
We are out of change Jerry 
Remind Mr. Rooney on Monday 
and he will give you 
a penny for your pains
Yes Ma'am
If I am alive
Yessir
 
Jerry
Did you hear what the hitch was?
Did you hear what kept the train so late?
How would he have heard? 
What was it Jerry?
It was a-
Leave the boy alone he knows nothing
Come on
What was it Jerry?
It was a little child Ma'am
What do you mean it was a little child?
It was a little child fell out of the carriage 
On to the line Ma'am
Under the wheels Ma'am
