Is that you, Christy?
It is, Ma'am.
I thought the hinny was familiar. 
How is your poor mother?
No better, Ma'am.
Your daughter then?
No worse, Ma'am.
Why do you halt? 
But why do I halt?
Nice day for the races.
Perhaps it is. 
But will it hold up?  
Will it hold up?
I suppose you wouldn't be in need--
Hist! 
Surely to goodness that couldn't be the 
up mail I hear already?
Damn the mail.
Oh thank God for that!
I could have sworn I heard it, 
thundering down the track in the far distance. 
I suppose you wouldn't be in need 
of a small load of 
dung?
Dung? 
What class of dung?
Stydung.
Stydung . . . 
I like your frankness, Christy. 
I'll ask the master. Christy.
 
Yes, Ma'am.
 
Do you find anything . . . 
bizarre about my way of speaking? 
 
I do not mean the voice. 
No, I mean the words. 
I use none but the 
simplest words, 
I think, 
and yet 
I 
sometimes 
find 
my 
way of speaking very . . .
bizarre. Mercy! - What was that?
Never mind her, Ma'am, 
she's very fresh in herself to-day.
Dung? What would we want with dung, 
at our time of life? 
Why are you on your feet down on the road? 
Why do you not climb up on the 
crest of your manure 
and let yourself be carried away? 
Is it that you have no head for heights?
Wiyya ta hell out of that!
She doesn't move a muscle.
I too should be getting along, 
if I do not wish to arrive 
late at the station. 
But a moment ago she 
neighed and pawed the ground.
And now she refuses to advance. 
Give her a good welt on the rump.
 
Harder!  
 
Well! If someone were to do that for me 
I wouldn't dally.
 
How she gazes at me to be sure, with her 
great 
moist 
cleg-tormented 
eyes! 
Perhaps 
if I were to move on,
down the road, 
out of her field of vision . . .  
 
No, no, enough! 
Take her by the snaffle and 
take her eyes away from me.
Oh this is awful  
 
What have I done to deserve all this, 
what, what?  
So long ago . . . 
No! No!  
"Sigh out a something something 
tale of things, Done long ago
and ill done."  
 
How can I go on, I cannot. 
Oh let me just flop down 
flat on the road like a 
big fat jelly out of a bowl and 
never move 
again! 
A great big slop 
thick with grit and dust and flies, 
they would have to scoop me up with a shovel. 
 
Heavens, there is that 
up mail again, 
 
what will become of me!  
 
Oh I am just a 
hysterical old hag I know, 
destroyed with sorrow and 
pining and gentility and 
church-going and fat and rheumatism 
and childlessness  
 
Minnie! 
Little Minnie! 
Love, love is all I asked, 
a little love, daily, 
 
twice daily, 
 
fifty years 
of twice daily love 
like a Paris horsebutcher's regular, 
what normal woman wants affection?
A kiss in the evening, near the ear, 
and another at morning,
peck, peck, 
till you grow whiskers on you. 
There is that lovely laburnum again. 


Pardon me if I 
do not doff my cap, 
I'd fall off. 
Divine day for the meeting.
Oh, Mr. Tyler, 
you startled the life out of me 
sneaking up beside me like that 
like a deer-stalker! 
Oh!
I rang my bell, Mrs. Rooney, 
the moment I spotted you 
I started tinkling my bell, 
now don't you deny it.
Your bell is one thing, 
and you are another. 
What news of your daughter?
 
fair 
 
fair 
 
they removed 
everything 
the whole . . . 
er . . . 
bag of tricks 
Now I am 
grandchild-less
 
Gracious how you wobble! 
Dismount, for mercy's sake, 
or ride on.
Perhaps 
if I 
were 
to place
my 
hand 
gently
on your shoulder, 
Mrs. Rooney, 
how would that be?  
Would you permit that?
No, Mr. Rooney, 
Mr. Tyler I mean,
  
I am tired 
of light old 
hands on my shoulders 
and other useless places, 
sick and tired of them. 
Heavens, 
here comes Connolly's van!  
 
Are you all right, Mr. Tyler?  
Where is he?  
 
Aah 
there you are!  
 
That was a narrow scrape
I alit in the nick of time.
It is suicide to be abroad. 
But what is it to be at home?
A lingering dissolution. 
Now we are white with dust 
from head to foot. 
I beg your pardon?

Nothing, Mrs. Rooney, 
nothing 
I was only
cursing, 
under my breath, 
God and man, 
under my breath, 
and the wet 
Saturday afternoon of my 
conception. 
My back 
tire has gone out again. 
I pumped it 
hard as iron 
before I went out. 
And now 
I am on the rim.
Oh what a shame!
Now if it were the front 
I would not so much mind. 
But the back. 
The back! 
The chain! 
The grease! 
The brakes! 
The gear! 
No! It is too much!
 
Are we 
already late? 
I have not the 
courage to 
look at my watch.
Late! 
I on my bicycle 
as I rolled along was
already 
late 
now therefore we are 
doubly 
late 
trebly 
quadrupedly late 
would I had shot by you 
without a word
 
Who are you 
going to meet?
Hardy  
We used to climb together  
I saved his life once  
I have not forgotten it
Let us a halt a moment and this 
vile dust 
fall back upon the 
viler worms.
 
What sky! 
What light! 
 
Ah in spite of all 
it is a blessed thing 
to be alive in such weather 
and out of hospital
Alive?
Well half alive shall we say?
Speak for yourself
I am not 
half alive 
nor anything approaching it 
What are we standing here for? 
This dust will not settle 
in our time 
and when it does some 
great 
whirring 
machine will 
come and blow it all 
sky high again
Well, shall we be getting along 
in that case?
No
Come, Mrs. Rooney--
Go, Mr. Tyler, 
go on and leave me, 
listening to the cooing of 
the ringdoves 
 
If you see 
my old blind Dan 
tell him I was 
on my way to meet him
when it all came 
over me again, 
like a flood. 
Say to him, 
Your poor wife, 
she told 
me to tell you it all came 
flooding over her 
again and she  
simply went back 
home 
 
straight 
back 
home 
 
Come 
Mrs. Rooney 
come 
the mail has not yet gone up 
just take my free arm 
and we'll be there 
with time and to spare.
 
What?
  
What's all this now? 
Can't you see Im in trouble? 
Have you no respect for misery? 
Minnie! 
Little Minnie!
Come 
Mrs. Rooney 
come 
the mail has not yet gone up 
just take my free arm 
and we'll be there 
with time and to 
spare.
  
Mrs Rooney ...
About forty now she'd be 
I don't know, 
fifty...  
 
girding up her 
lovely little loins 
getting ready for 
the change ...
 
for the change...
 
Will you get along with you, 
Mr. Rooney, 
Mr. Tyler I mean, 
will you get along with you now 
and cease molesting me? 
 
What kind of a country 
is this where a 
woman can't 
cry her eyes out in the 
highways and byways 
without being molested 
by retired 
bill-brokers! 
 
Heavens, 
you're not 
going to ride her flat! 
You'll tear your tube to ribbons! 
 
Venus birds! 
Cooing in the night
all the long 
summer long.  
 
Oh cursed corset! 
 
If I could only 
let it out, 
without indecent exposure. 
Mr. Tyler! 
Mr. Tyler! 
Come back and unlace me 
behind the hedge! 
What's wrong with me, 
what's wrong with me, 
never tranquil, 
seething out of my 
dirty old pelt, 
out of my skull!
Oh to be in atoms, 
in atoms! 
ATOMS!
 
Jesus!  
Jesus!

Is anything 
wrong, Mrs. Rooney? 
You are bent all double 
Have you a pain in your stomach? 
Well, if it isn't 
my old admirer 
the Clerk of the Course 
in his limousine
May I offer you a 
lift, Mrs. Rooney? 
Are you going in 
my direction?
I am 
we all are  
How is your poor mother?
Thank you 
she is fairly comfortable 
We manage 
to keep her 
out of pain 
That is the great thing 
Mrs. Rooney 
is it not?
Yes, indeed, Mr. Slocum 
that is the great thing 
I don't know how you do it 
Ah these wasps!
May I then offer you 
a lift, Madam?
Oh that would be 
heavenly 
Mr. Slocum 
simply heavenly  
But would I ever get in 
you look very 
high off the 
ground to-day, 
these new balloon 
tires, I presume
Does this roof
never come off? 
No? 
No
I'll never do it
you'll have to get down 
Mr. Slocum 
and help me from 
the rear  
What was that?  
This is all 
your suggestion Sir
drive on
I'm coming, Mrs. Rooney 
I'm coming, give me time 
I'm as stiff as yourself
Stiff! 
Well I like that! 
And me heaving all over 
back and front  
The dry old reprobate!
Now 
how shall we do this?
As if I were a bale
don't be afraid  
That's the way!  
Lower! 
Wait! 
No, don't let go! 
Suppose I do get up 
will I ever get down?
You'll get down
Mrs. Rooney
you'll get down
We may not get you up
but I warrant you
you'll get you down
Oh! 
Lower! 
Don't be afraid! 
We're past the age when
There!
Now
Get your shoulder under it
Oh
Oh
Oh mercy
Up Up
AAM
I'm in
My frock
You've nipped my frock
My nice frock
Look what you've done to
my nice frock
What will Dan say
when he sees me?
Has he then
recovered his sight?
No
I mean when he knows
what will he say when he
feels the hole? 
What are you doing, Mr. Slocum?
Gazing straight before me
through the windshield
out at the void
Start her up, I beseech you
and let us be off
This is awful!
Last Sunday she
ran like a
dream
and now she is
dead
That is what you get
for a good deed
Perhaps if I were to choke her 
She was getting too much air!
Mind the hen!
Oh mother, you have squashed her,
drive on, drive on!
What a death!
One minute picking happy at the dung
in the road, in the sun
with now and then a dust bath
and then
--bang!--
all her troubles over
all the hatching and the laying
Just one great squawk and then
peace
They would have
slit her weasand
in any case
Here we are
let me out
What are you up to now
Mr. Slocum?
We are at a standstill
all danger is past
and you blow your horn
Now if instead of
blowing it now
you had blown it at that
unfortunate--
Will you come here
Tommy
and help this lady out 
she's stuck
Open the door
and ease her out
Certainly, Sir
Nice day for the races
Who do you fancy
Don't mind me
Don't take any notice of me
I do not exist
The fact is
well known
Do as you're told Tommy
for goodness sake
Yessir
now, Ms. Rooney
wait! Tommy wait!
don't bustle me
let me just wheel round and get my feet to the ground
now
 
watch your feather ma'am
easy now,
easy
Wait for god's sake
You'll have me beheaded
Crouch
down Ms. Rooney
crouch down and get your head into the open
Crouch down at my time of life
this is lunacy
press her down
merde 
now
she's coming
straighten up now
there am I in?
Tommy?
Tommy?
where the hell are you?
you wouldn't have something for the Ladies' plate sir?
I was given Flash Harry
Flash Harry
that carthorse
Tommy
Blast your bleeding bloody
oh, Ms. Rooney
who was that crucifying his gear box Tommy
Old Cissy Slocum
Cissy Slocum
That's a nice way to refer to your elders
Cissy Slocum and you an orphan 
What are you doing stravaging down here on the public road?
This is no place for you at all 
Get up here on the platform now,
and whip out the truck
nice to see you up and about 
again you were laid up there a long time
not long enough Mr. barrell
would I were still in bed, Mr. Barrell
would I were still laid up in my comfortable bed, Mr. Barrell
Just wasting
slowly
painlessly
away
keeping up my strength with arrowroot and calf's foot jelly
till in the end you couldn't see me under the covers any
more than a board, 
oh no coughing
or spitting
or bleeding or sweating or vomiting, just drifting 
slowly 
down into the higher light,
and remembering
remembering all the silly unhappiness as though
it had never happened
 
How long have you been master of this station now Mr. Barrell?
don't ask me Ms. Rooney,
don't ask me
You stepped into your father's shoes,
I suppose when he took them off
Poor pappy
He didn't live long
to enjoy his rest
I remember him clearly
a small
ferrety purple faced widower
deaf as a doornail
very
testy and snappy
I suppose
You'll be retiring soon yourself
Mr. Barrell and growing your roses
did I understand you to say
the twelve thirty will soon be upon us?
this were my words
but according to my watch 
which is more or less right
or was according to the eight o clock news
the time is now
getting up to twelve
thirty six
and yet upon the other
hand the up mail has not yet gone through
or has it slipped by me 
unbeknownst to me 
for there was a time there I remember it 
now
I was so plunged in sorrow
I wouldn't have heard a steamroller go over me 
don't go Mr. Barrell
Mr. Barrell
Mr. Barrell
What is it ma'am?
I have my work to do
 
the wind is getting up
the best of the day is
over soon 
the rain
will begin to fall
and go on falling
all afternoon
 
then at evening
 
the clouds
will part
 
the setting sun will shine a moment and sink behind the trees
Mr. Barrell
Mr. Barrell
Mr. Barrell
I estrange them all
They come towards you
uninvited
bygones bygones
full of kindness genuinely pleased 
to see you again looking so well 
a few simple words from my heart and I am all alone once more 
 
Ms Fitt
am I then invisible Ms. Fitt
Is this cretonne so becoming to me that I merge into the masonry?
that's right
Look closely
and you will finally distinguish a once female form
Ms. Rooney
I saw you but I didn't know you
Last Sunday we worshipped together
We knelt side by side at the same altar
drank from the same chalice
have I so changed since then
oh, but in church, Ms. Rooney
in church I am alone with my maker
are not you?
why even the pastor himself, you know
when he takes up the collection knows
that it's useless to pause before me
I simply do not see the plate, or bag, or whatever
it is they use
how could I?
Why even when all is over 
and I go out in to the sweet fresh air,
why even then, 
for the first hour or so
I stumble in a kind of daze as you might say 
oblivious to my core
ligionists and they are very 
kind I must admit 
the vast majority very kind and understanding,
they know me now and take no umbrage
there she goes,
they say,
there goes The Dark Miss Fitt,
alone with her maker
take no notice of her,
and they step down off the path to avoid my running in to them
Ah yes, I am distrait
very distrait 
even on weekdays 
ask my mother if you do not believe me
'Hettie' 
she says when I start eating my doily 
instead of the thin bread and butter
'Hettie' how can you be so distrait?
I believe the truth is 
I'm just not there, Ms. Rooney
just not really there at all
I eat drink sleep,
I go through the usual motions but my
 
heart isn't in it,
but heart
 
is in none of it
left to myself,
with no one to stop me 
I would soon be flown
 
home
so if you think I
cut you just now Ms. Rooney 
you do me an injustice
All I see is a big red blur
Is something amiss, Ms. Rooney
you don't seem normal somehow
so bowed and bent?
Maddy Rooney nee Dunne
the big red blur,
you have piercing sight, Ms. Fitt,
literally piercing well
is there anything I can do now that I'm here?
If you could help me up the face of this cliff,
I have little doubt your maker would requite you
if no one else
Now now, Ms. Rooney
don't put your teeth into me
requite
I make these sacrifices for nothing 
or not at all
I take it you want to lean on me?
 
I asked Mr. Barrell to give me his arm
just give me his arm
he turned on his heels and strode away
Is it my arm you want then?
Is it my arm you want?
or what is it?
Your arm
 
any arm
a helping hand,
for one moment
Christ, what a planet
really
do you know what it is Ms. Rooney
I don't think it is wise of you to be going about at all
come down here Ms. Fitt and give me your arm 
before I scream down the whole county
 
Well I suppose it is the protestant thing to do
 
Pismires do it
for one another
 
I have seen slugs do it
 
no the other side if its just the same to you
I'm left handed on top of
everything else
 
heavens child
you're just a bag of bones
you need building up
 
this is worse than the Matterhorn
have you ever been up the Matterhorn?
great honeymoon resort
 
why don't they have a handrail?
 
wait
 
till I
 
catch my breath
don't drop me
 
then encircling 
gloom
turn
turn me on
the night is dark and I am 
far from home
tum tum
stop it Ms. Rooney
 
Thank you Ms. Fitt
thank you
 
that will do
just prop me
up against the wall 
like a load of tarpaulin 
and that will be all for the moment 
I am sorry for 
all this ramdam Ms. Fitt
had I known you were 
looking for your mother
I should not have opportuned you
I know what it is 
Ramdam
come Dolly darling
let us take up our stand before the
first class smokers
take my hand
and hold me tight
you can be pulled under
you have lost your mother Ms. Fitt?
Good morning Mr. Tyler
Good morning Ms. Fitt
Good morning Ms. Fitt
Good morning Mr. Barrell
 
you have lost your mother Ms. Fitt
she said she would be on the 
last train
do not imagine because I am silent
that I am not present and a live to 
all that is going on
When you say the last train
do not flatter yourself
for one moment
because I hold aloof that my 
sufferings have ceased 
 
no
 
the entire scene 
the hills
the plain
the racecourse 
with its miles and miles of
white fence and
three red stands
 
the pretty little wayside station
even you yourself, yes
I mean it and over all the clouding blue
I see it all
I stand here and see it all with the eyes 
though eyes
Oh if you had my eyes
you would understand the things they have seen 
and not looked away
this is
 
nothing
nothing
where did I put that handkerchief?
when you say they last train
phphp
when you say the last train
I take it you mean the twelve thirty
what else would I mean?
what else could I conceivably mean?
then you have no cause for anxiety Ms. Fitt
for the twelve thirty has not yet arrived
there
no up the line
no Ms. Fitt
follow the direction of my finger
 
there you see it 
the signal at the 
bawdy hour of nine
or three alas
 
thank you Mr. Barrell
but the time is now
getting on to 
we all know Ms. Fitt
we all know only too wee
what the time is now
getting on to 
and yet the cruel fact remains the twelve thirty 
has not yet arrived
not an accident I trust?
do not tell me it has left the track
Darling Mother 
with the cold fish for lunch
that's enough guff out of you
nip up on the platform now
and see has Mr. Clark
anything for us
Poor Dan
what terrible thing has happened 
now now Ms. Fitt do
Poor Dan
now now Ms. Fitt do not 
give way to despair
all will come right in the end 
what is the situation Mr. Barrell 
not a collision surely 
a collision that would be wonderful
a collision
I knew it
Come, Ms. Fitt 
let us move a little up the platform
yes let us all do that
no?
you have changed your mind
