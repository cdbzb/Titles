Is anything 
wrong, Mrs. Rooney? 
You are bent all double 
Have you a pain in the stomach? 
Well, if it isn't 
my old admirer 
the Clerk of the Course 
in his limousine
May I offer you a 
lift, Mrs. Rooney? 
Are you going in 
my direction?
I am 
we all are  
How is your poor mother?
Thank you 
she is fairly comfortable 
We manage 
to keep her 
out of pain 
That is the great thing 
Mrs. Rooney 
is it not?
Yes, indeed, Mr. Slocum 
that is the great thing 
I don't know how you do it 
Ah these wasps!
May I then offer you 
a seat, Madam?
Oh that would be 
heavenly 
Mr. Slocum 
simply heavenly  
But would I ever get in 
you look very 
high off the 
ground to-day, 
these new balloon 
tires, I presume...
Does this roof
never come off? 
No? 
No
I'll never do it
you'll have to get down 
Mr. Slocum 
and help me from 
the rear  
What was that?  
This is all 
your suggestion Sir
drive on
I'm coming, Mrs. Rooney 
I'm coming, give me time 
I'm as stiff as yourself
Stiff! 
Well I like that! 
And me heaving all over 
back and front  
The dry old reprobate!
Now 
how shall we do this?
As if I were a bale
don't be afraid  
That's the way!  
Lower! 
Wait! 
No, don't let go! 
Suppose I do get up 
will I ever get down?
You'll get down
Mrs. Rooney
you'll get down
We may not get you up
but I warrant you
we'll get you down
Oh! 
Lower! 
Don't be afraid! 
We're past the age when
There!
Now!
Get your shoulder under it
Oh!
Oh glory!
Up! Up!
AM!
I'm in! 
My frock!
You've nipped my frock! 
My nice frock! 
Look what you've done to
my nice frock! 
What will Dan say
when he sees me?
Has he then
recovered his sight?
No
I mean when he knows
what will he say when he
feels the hole? 
What are you doing, Mr. Slocum?
Gazing straight before me
, Mrs. Rooney,
through the windscreen
into the void
Start her up, I beseech you
and let us be off
This is awful!
All morning she
went like a
dream
and now she is
dead
That is what you get
for a good deed
Perhaps if I were to choke her 
She was getting too much air!
Mind the hen!
Oh mother, you have squashed her,
drive on, drive on!
What a death!
One minute picking happy at the dung
on the road, in the sun
with now and then a dust bath
b with now and then a dust bath and then
and then
--bang!--
all her troubles over
all the laying and the hatching
Just one great squawk and then
peace
They would have
slit her weasand
in any case
Here we are
let me down
What are you up to now
Mr. Slocum?
We are at a standstill
all danger is past
and you blow your horn
Now if instead of
blowing it now
you had blown it at that
unfortunate--
Will you come down
Tommy
and help this lady out 
she's stuck
Open the door
Tommy
and ease her out
Certainly, Sir
Nice day for the races, Sir
What would you fancy for
Don't mind me
Don't take any notice of me
I do not exist
The fact is
well known


Tommy! Tommy! Where the hell is he?
