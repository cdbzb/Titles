Oh Dan there you are 
 
Where in the world were you?
Maddy
Where were you all this time?
In the men's
Kiss me
Kiss you? 
In the station?
On the platform? 
Before the boy? Have you taken leave of your senses?
Jerry wouldn't mind Would you, Jerry?
No Ma'am
What news of your father?
They took him away, Ma'am
Then you are all alone?
Yes, Ma'am
Why are you here? 
You did not notify me
I wanted to give you a surprise for your birthday
My birthday?
Have you not forgotten it?
I wished you your happy returns in the bathroom
I did not hear you
But I gave you a tie 
You have it on
What age am I now?
Now never mind about that 
Come
Why did you not cancel the boy? 
Now we shall have to give him a penny
I forgot
I had such a time getting here
Such horrid nasty people
 
Be nice to me Dan
Be nice to me today 
 
Give the boy a penny
Here are two halfpennies Jerry 
Buy yourself a nice gobstopper.
Yes Ma'am
Come for me on Wednesday if I am still alive
Yessir
 
We could have saved sixpence
We have saved fivepence
But at what price?
 
Are you not well?
Once and for all do not ask me to 
move and speak at the same time
I shall not say this in this life again

Are you not--
Let us get this precipice over
Put your arms around me
Have you been drinking again? 
You are quivering like a blanc-mange 
Are you in a condition to lead me?
We shall fall into the ditch
Oh Dan It will be like old times
Pull yourself together or I shall send Tommy for the cab
Then instead of having saved sixpence
no fivepence, we would have lost  
two and three less six one and no plus one one and no 
plus three 
one and nine and one 
ten and three 
two and one 
two and one 
we shall be the poorer to the tune of two and one 
Damn that sun it has gone in 
What is the day doing?
 
Shrouding
Shrouding 
The best of it has gone
Soon the first great drops will fall 
Splashing in the dust
 
And yet the glass was firm
Let us hasten home 
and sit before the fire
We will draw the blinds
You will read to me
I think Effie is going to commit adultery 
with the Major (neighbor??)
 
Wait
I have been up and down these stairs ten thousand times 
and still I do not know how many there are 
When I think there are six there are four or five or seven 
or eight 
and when I remember 
there are five 
there are three or four 
or seven or six and 
when finally I realize there are seven 
there are five or six or eight or nine
Sometimes I wonder if they do not change them in the night
Well? How many do you make them to be?

Do not ask me to count not now. 
Not count 
One of the few great pleasures in life?
Not steps Dan please I always get them wrong
Then you might fall on your wound and I would have that on my manure-heap 
on top of everything else
No
just cling to me and all will be well
Well
That is what she calls well
We are down 
And little the worse
 
That was a true donkey. Its father and mother were donkeys. [whole line missing]
Do you know what it is I think I will retire
Retire 
And stay at home? 
On your grant!
Never tread these cursed steps again 
Trudge this hellish road [stairs] for the last time. 
Stay at home on the remnants 
of my bottom 
counting the days till the next meal
The very thought puts life in me
Hurry before it dies!
 
Now mind here is the path
 
Up 
 
Well done
 
Now we are in safety and a straight run home
A straight . . . run
 
. . She calls that 
. . . a straight 
. . . run! . .
Hush! do not speak as you go along
you know it is not good for your coronary
Just concentrate on putting 
one foot before the next 
or whatever the expression is
 
That's the way
 
Now we are doing nicely 
 
Heavens
I knew there was something
With all the excitement
I forgot
Good God
But you must know Dan 
of course you were on it 
What ever happened 
Tell me
I have never known anything to happen
But you must--
All this starting and stopping again is devilish
devilish
I get a little way on me and begin to be carried 
along 
when suddenly you stop dead 
Two hundred pounds of unhealthy flesh
What possessed you to come out at all
Let go of me
No I must know we won't leave until you tell me
Fifteen minutes late
On a fifteen minute run 
It's unheard of
I know nothing 
Let go of me before I shake you off
But you must know 
You were on it
Was it at the terminus? 
Did you leave on time? 
Or was it on the line?
Did something happen on the line?
Dan
Why won't you tell me?
Poor Maddy (this Line HERE??)
  
What was that?
 
The Lynch twins jeering at us
Will they pelt us with mud to-day do you suppose?
Let us turn and face them
Threaten them with your stick
They have run away
Did you ever wish to kill a child?  
Nip some young doom in the bud
Many a time at night in winter on the black road home I nearly attacked the boy
Poor Jerry 
What restrained me then? 
Not fear of man 
Shall we go on backwards now a little?
Backwards?

Yes 
Or you forwards and I backwards 
The perfect pair 
Like Dante's damned 
with their faces arsy-versy
Our tears will water our bottoms

What is the matter Dan? Are you not well?

Well
Have you ever known me to be well?
The day you met me I should have been in bed
The day you proposed to me the doctors gave me up 
You knew that did you not? 
The night you married me they came for me with an ambulance
You have not forgotten that I suppose?
No, I cannot be said to be well. But I am no worse
In fact I am better than I was 
The loss of my sight was a great fillip
If I could go deaf and dumb I might pant on to be a hundredOr have I done so? 
Am I a hundred to-day? 
Am I a hundred Maddy?
 
All is still
No living soul in sight
There is no one to ask 
The world is 
 
feeding
 
The wind
barely moves
the leaves and the birds
are tired singing
The cows
and sheep
ruminate in silence
The dogs are hushed 
and the hens
sprawl 
torpid in the dust
We are alone
There is no one to ask
 
We set out on the tick of time, 
I can vouch for that 
I was
How can you vouch for it?
I can vouch for it I tell you! 
Do you want my relation or don't you? 
On the tick of time
I had the compartment to myself 
At least I thought I did
for I made no attempt to restrain myself
My mind--
But why did we not sit down somewhere? 
Are we afraid we shall never rise again?
Sit down on what?
On a bench for example
There is no bench
On a bank let us sink down on a bank
There is no bank
Then we cannot
I dream of other roads
in other lands
Of another home
another--
--another home. 
What was I talking about?
Something about your mind
My mind? 
Are you sure
My mind?  
Ah yes
 
Alone in the compartment 
my mind began to work
as so often after office hours 
on the way home
on the train 
to the lilt of the bogeys
 
Your season-ticket I said
costs you twelve [twenty(?)]pounds a year 
and you earn on an average seven and six a day 
which is to say barely enough 
to keep you alive 
and twitching with the help 
of food
drink
tobacco 
and periodicals 
until I finally reach home 
and fall into bed
Add to that--or subtract from it--
rent
stationery
various subscriptions
tram fares to and fro
light and heat 
permits and licences 
haircuts and shaves
tips to escorts
upkeep of premises and appearances
and a thousand unspecifiable 
sundries and it is clear that by lying at home in bed 
day and night 
winter and summer with a change of pyjamas 
once a fortnight you would add 
very considerably to your income 
Business I said--
 
Did I hear a cry?
Mrs. Tully I fancy
Her poor husband is in constant pain 
and beats her unmercifully
That was a short knock
What was I trying to get at?
Business
Ah yes
Business old man 
I said retire from business
It has retired from you 
One has these moments of lucidity
I feel very cold and weak
On the other hand I said
there are the 
horrors of home life 
the dusting 
sweeping 
airing
scraping 
waxing
waning 
washing 
mangling 
drying
mowing 
clipping 
raking
rolling 
scuffling 
shoveling
grinding 
tearing 
pounding 
banging and slamming
And the brats
the happy little hearty little howling neighbours' brats
Of all this and much more the week-end, the Saturday intermission and then the day of rest, have given you some idea. [*not sure about this whole line*]
But what must it be like on a working-day? 
A Wednesday? 
A Friday
What must it be like on a Friday
 
And I started thinking of my 
 
silent
backstreet 
basement office
with its obliterated plate 
rest-couch and velvet curtains
and what it means to be buried there 
alive
if only from nine to five
with convenient to the one hand 
a bottle of light pale ale 
and to the other 
a long ice-cold fillet of hake
 
Nothing I said
not even fully certified death
can take the place of that
It was then I noticed 
we were at a standstill 
Why are you hanging out of me like that?
Have you swooned away?
 
I feel very cold and faint
The wind
is whistling through my summer frock as if I had 
nothing on over my bloomers
I have had no solid food 
since my elevenses
You have ceased to care
I sing and you listen to the wind
  
Where was I in my composition?
At a standstill
Ah yes
I concluded naturally that we had entered a station and would soon be on our way again
and I sat on without misgiving 
Not a sound 
nobody getting on [?], nobody getting off 
Then as time goes by and nothing happens I realize my error
We had not entered a station
Did you not spring up and poke your head out of the window?
What good would that have done me?
Why to call out to be told what was amiss
I did not care what was amiss
No I just sat on thinking 
If this train were never to move again 
I would not greatly mind
Then gradually I--how you say
a growing desire to--er--you know--
welled up inside me 
Nervous probably 
In fact now I am sure
You know the feeling of being confined
 
Yes yes, I have been through that
 
If we sit here much longer I said 
I really do not know what I shall do 
 
After what seemed an eternity we simply moved off
And the next thing was Barrell bawling the abhorred name
I got down and Jerry led me to the men's
 
Say something, Maddy. 
 
I remember 
once attending a lecture by one of these new mind doctors, 
I forget what you call them. He spoke--

A lunatic specialist? 

No no, just the troubled mind, I was hoping he might shed a little light on my lifelong preoccupation with horses' buttocks.

A Psychologist?

No no  just mental distress
the name will come back to me in the night 
I remember his telling us the story 
of a little girl very strange and 
unhappy in her ways
and how he treated her unsuccessfully 
over a period of years 
and was finally obliged 
to give up the case
He could find nothing wrong with her he said 
The only thing wrong with her 
as far as he could see was 
that she was dying
And she did in fact die 
just as soon as he had washed his hands of her 
Well? What is there so wonderful about that?
No it was just something he said
and the way he said it 
that have haunted me ever since
 
He had done with the little girl 
he stood there motionless for some time 
quite two minutes I should say
looking down at his table
Then he suddenly raised his head and exclaimed
as if he bad had a revelation 
 
The trouble with her was she had never really been born
Nothing about your buttocks? 
 
Maddy
There is nothing to be done for those people
For which is there?
That does not sound right somehow
What way am I facing?
What?
I have forgotten which way I am facing
You have turned away and are bowed down over the ditch
There is a dead dog in there
No no just the [us?] rotting leaves
In June? Rotting leaves in June?
Yes dear
from last year
and the year before that 
and the year before that again
There is that lovely laburnum again 
Poor thing she is losing all her tassels
 
There are the first drops
 
Golden drizzle
 
I am just thinking to myself
Can [do] hinnies procreate I wonder
Say that again
Come on dear don't mind me 
we are getting drenched [?]
Can what what?
Hinnies procreate 
You know
No
Then why do you halt?
It is easier
Are you very wet?
To the buff
The buff?
The buff 
From [the?] buffalo
Let us [?] hang up all our things in the hotcupboard
and get into our dressing-gowns
Put your arm round me
Be nice to me
Ah Dan
 
All day the same old record. 
All alone in that great empty house
She must be a very old woman now
 
Death and the Maiden
Are you crying?
Are you crying?
Yes! 
 
Who is the preacher to-morrow? The incumbent?
No
Thank God for that 
Who?
Hardy
"How to be Happy though Married"?
No no he died you remember 
No relation [?]
Has he announced the text?
"The Lord upholdeth all that fall and raiseth up all those that be bowed down." 
  
I hear something behind us
It looks like Jerry
It is Jerry
You dropped--
Take your time my little man 
you will burst a bloodvessel.
You dropped something Sir
Mr. Barrell told me to run after you
Show
What is it?  
What is this thing Dan?
Perhaps it is not mine at all
Mr. Barrell said it is Sir
It looks like a kind of ball and yet it is not a ball
It is a thing I carry about with me
Yes but what--
It is a thing I carry about with me
I have no small money have you?
I have none of any kind
We are out of change Jerry 
Remind Mr. Rooney on Monday 
and he will give you a penny for your pains
Yes, Ma'am
If I am alive
Yessir
Jerry
Did you hear what the hitch was?
Did you hear what kept the train so late?
How would he have heard? 
What was it Jerry?
It was a--
Leave the boy alone, he knows nothing
Come on
What was it Jerry?
It was a little child Ma'am
What do you mean, it was a little child?
It was a little child fell out of the carriage 
On to the line Ma'am
Under the wheels Ma'am
