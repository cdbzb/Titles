Oh, Dan! There you are! 
 
Where in the world were you?
Maddy. 
Where were you all this time?
In the men's
Kiss me!
Kiss you? 
in the station?
On the platform? Before the boy? 
Have you taken leave of your senses?
Jerry wouldn't mind. Would you, Jerry?
No, Ma'am
What news of your father?
They took him away
Then you are all alone?
Yes, Ma'am
Why are you here? 
You did not notify me
I wanted to give you a surprise. For your birthday
My birthday?
you  have not forgotten it?
I wished you your happy returns in the bathroom
I did not hear you
But I gave you a tie! 
You have it on
How old am I now? 
Now never mind that. 
Come
Why did you not cancel the boy? 
Now we shall have to give him a penny
I forgot! 
I had such a time getting here 
Such horrid nasty people  
 
Be nice to me, Dan, 
be nice to me today! 
 
Give the boy a penny 
Here are two halfpennies, Jerry 
buy yourself a nice gobstopper
Yes, Ma'am
Come for me Wednesday, if I am still alive
Yessir
 
We could have saved sixpence 
We have saved fivepence  
But at what price?
 
Are you not well?
Once and for all, do not ask me to 
move and speak at the same time. 
I shall not say this in this life again

Are you not...
Let us get this 
 
precipice over
Put your arm round me
Have you been drinking again? 
You are quivering like a blanc-mange 
Are you in a condition to lead me?
We shall fall into the ditch!
Oh, Dan! It will be like old times!
Pull yourself together or I shall send 
Tommy for the cab 
Then, instead of having saved sixpence, 
no, fivepence, we would have lost  
two and three less six 
one and no plus one 
one and no plus three 
one and nine and one 
ten and three 
 
two and one 
 
two and one, 
we shall be the poorer to the tune of 
two and one 
Damn the sun, it has gone in  
What is the day doing?
 
Shrouding 
 
shrouding 
the best of it has gone
Soon 
the first great drops will fall 
splashing in the dust
 
And yet the glass was fir
Let us 
hasten home 
and sit before the fire 
We shall draw the blinds 
You will read to me 
I think Effie is going 
\to commit adultery 
with the Major
 
Wait! 
I have been up and down these stairs ten thousand times 
and still I do not know how many there are 
When I think there are six there are four or five or seven 
or eight 
and when I remember 
there are five 
there are three or four 
or six [seven] or seven [six] and 
when finally I realize there are seven 
there are five or six or eight or nine. 
Sometimes I wonder if they do not change them in the night. 
Well? How many do you make them to-day? [out to be?]
 
Do not ask me to count, Dan, ["Dan" missing] not now. 
Not count! One of the few satisfactions [great pleasures] in life?
Not steps, Dan, please, I always get them wrong. 
Then you might fall on your wound and I would have that on my manure-heap 
on top of everything else. 
No, 
just cling to me and all will be well
Well! 
That is what you [she] call [calls] well!
We are down. And little the worse. 
 
do you know what it is, I think I will retire
retire! And stay at home? 
on your grant!
never tread these cursed road again. 
trudge these hellish stairs for the last time. 
stay at home on the remnants 
of my bottom 
counting the hours [days]--till the next meal. 
The very thought puts life in me! 
Forward, [Hurry,] before it dies!
 
Now mind, here is the path . . . 
 
Up! . . 
 
Well done! 
 
Now we are in safety and a straight run home
a straight run!
 
She calls that 
a straight 
run!
hush! do not speak as you go along, 
you know it is not good for your coronary
just concentrate on putting 
one foot before the next 
or whatever the expression is 
 
That is the way, 
 
now we are doing nicely. 
 
Heavens! 
I knew there was something! 
With all the excitement! 
I forgot!
Good God
But you must know, Dan, 
of course, you were on it
What ever happened? 
Tell me!
I have never known anything to happen
But you must--
All this stopping and starting [starting and stopping] again is devilish, 
devilish! 
I get a little way on me and begin to be carried 
along 
when suddenly you stop dead! 
Two hundred pounds of unhealthy flesh! 
What possessed you to come out at all? 
Let go of me!
No, I must know, we won't leave until you tell me 
Fifteen minutes late! 
On a fifteen minute run! 
It's unheard of!
I know nothing 
Let go of me before I shake you off
But you must know! You were on it! 
Was it at the terminus? 
Did you leave on time? 
Or was it on the line?
Did something happen on the line?
Dan! 
Why won't you tell me!
  
What was that?
 
The Lynch twins jeering at us
Will they pelt us with mud to-day, do you suppose?
Let us turn and face them
Threaten them with your stick
They have run away
Did you ever wish to kill a child?  
Nip some young doom in the bud 
Many a time at night, in winter, on the 
long road home, I nearly attacked the boy 
Poor Jerry! 
What restrained me then? 
Not fear of man 
  
Shall we go on backwards now a little?
Backwards?
Or you forwards and I backwards. The perfect pair. Like Dante's damned, 
with their faces arsy-versy. Our tears 
will water our bottoms
 
What is the matter, Dan? Are you not well?
Well! Have you ever known me to be well?
The day you met me I should have been in bed 
The day you proposed to me the doctors gave me up 
You knew that, did you not? 
The night you married me they came for me with an ambulance 
You have not forgotten that, I suppose?
No, I cannot be said to be well. But I am no worse 
Indeed [In fact] I am better than I was 
The loss of my sight was a great fillip 
If I could go deaf and dumb I might pant on to be a hundred
Or have I done so? 
Am I a hundred to-day? 
Am I a hundred, Maddy?
  
All is still 
No living soul in sight. 
There is no one to ask. 
The world is 
  
feeding 
 
The wind--
barely moves 
the leaves and the birds--
--are tired singing. 
The cows--
--and sheep--
--ruminate in silence. 
The dogs----are hushed 
and the hens--
--sprawl 
torpid in the dust. 
We are alone. 
There is no one to ask.
 
We drew [set] out on the tick of time, 
I can vouch for that. I was--
How can you vouch for it?
I can vouch for it, I tell you! 
Do you want my relation or don't you? 
On the tick of time. 
I had the compartment to myself, as usual. ["as usual" missing]
At least I hope so, [I thought I did,] 
for I made no attempt to restrain myself. 
My mind--
But why do [did] we not sit down somewhere? 
Are we afraid we should [shall] never rise again?
Sit down on what?
On a bench, for example.
There is no bench.
Then ["Then" missing] on a bank, let us sink down upon [on] a bank.
There is no bank.
Then we cannot.
I dream of other roads, 
in other lands. 
Of another home, 
another--
--another home. 
What was I trying to say? [talking about?]
Something about your mind.
My mind? 
Are you sure. 
My mind? . . 
Ah yes. 
 
Alone in the compartment 
my mind began to work, 
as so often after office hours, 
on the way home, 
in [on] the train, 
to the lilt of the bogeys. 
 
Your season-ticket, I said, 
costs you twelve [twenty(?)]pounds a year 
and you earn, on an average, seven and six a day, 
that [which] is to say barely enough 
to keep you alive 
and twitching with the help 
of food, 
drink, 
tobacco 
and periodicals 
until you [I] finally reach home 
and fall into bed. 
Add to this [that]--or subtract from it--
rent, 
stationery, 
various subscriptions, 
tramfares to and fro, 
light and heat, 
permits and licences, 
hairtrims [haircuts] and shaves, 
tips to escorts, 
upkeep of premises and appearances, 
and a thousand unspecifiable 
sundries, and it is clear that by lying at home in bed, 
day and night, 
winter and summer, with a change of pyjamas 
once a fortnight, you would add 
very considerably to your income. 
Business, I said--
 
Did I hear a cry?
Mrs. Tully, I fancy. 
Her poor husband is in constant pain 
and beats her unmercifully.
That was a short knock.  
What was I trying to get at?
Business.
Ah yes, business. ["business" missing]
Business, old man, 
I said, retire from business, 
it has retired from you. 
One has these moments of lucidity.
I feel very cold and weak.
On the other hand, I said, 
there are the 
horrors of home life, 
the dusting, 
sweeping, 
airing, 
scrubbing [scraping], 
waxing, 
waning, 
washing, 
mangling, 
drying, 
mowing, 
clipping, 
raking, 
rolling, 
scuffling, 
shovelling [shoveling (sp)], 
grinding, 
tearing, 
pounding, 
banging and slamming. 
And the brats, 
the happy little hearty little howling neighbours' brats. 
Of all this and much more the week-end, the Saturday intermission and then the day of rest, have given you some idea. [*not sure about this whole line*]
But what must it be like on a working-day? 
A Wednesday? 
A Friday! 
What must it be like on a Friday! 
 
And I fell to thinking of my 
 
silent, 
backstreet, 
basement office, 
with its obliterated plate, 
rest-couch and velvet hangings, [curtains,]
and what it means to be buried there 
alive, 
if only from ten [nine] to five, 
with convenient to the one hand 
a bottle of light pale ale 
and to the other 
a long ice-cold fillet of hake. 
 
Nothing, I said, 
not even fully certified death, 
can ever ["ever" missing] take the place of that. 
It was then I noticed 
we were at a standstill. 
Why are you hanging out of me like that? Have you swooned away?

I feel very cold and faint. 
The wind-- 
--is whistling through my summer frock as if I had 
nothing on over my bloomers. 
I have had no solid food 
since my elevenses.
You have ceased to care. 
I speak [sing] --and you listen to the wind.
 
*["No no, I am agog, tell me all, then we shall press on and never pause, never pause, till we come safe to haven.

Never pause . . . safe to haven . . . Do you know, Maddy, sometimes one would think you were struggling with a dead language.
Yes indeed, Dan, I know full well what you mean, I often have that feeling, it is unspeakably excruciating.
I confess I have it sometimes myself, when I happen to overhear what I am saying.
Well, you know, it will be dead in time, just like our own poor dear Gaelic, there is that to be said.
Good God!
Oh, the pretty little woolly lamb, crying to suck its mother! Theirs has not changed, since Arcady." All missing.]*
 
Where was I in my composition?
At a standstill.
Ah yes. 
I concluded naturally that we had entered a station and would soon be on our way again, and I sat on, without misgiving. 
Not a sound. Things are very dull to-day, I said, nobody getting down, nobody getting on. 
Then as time flew [goes] by and nothing happened [happens] I realized [realize] my error. 
We had not entered a station.
Did you not spring up and poke your head out of the window?
What good would that have done me?
Why to call out to be told what was amiss.
I did not care what was amiss. 
No, I just sat on, saying, [thinking,] 
If this train were never to move again 
I should [would] not greatly mind.  
Then gradually a--how shall I say-- *["Then gradually I--how you say"]*
a growing desire to--er--you know--
welled up within [inside] me. 
Nervous probably. In fact now I am sure. You know, the feeling of being confined.

Yes yes, I have been through that.

If we sit here much longer, I said, I really do not know what I shall do. I got up and paced to and fro between the seats, like a caged beast.

That is a help sometimes. 

After what seemed an eternity we simply moved off. And the next thing was Barrell bawling the abhorred name. 
I got down and Jerry led me to the men's, or Fir as they call it now, from Vir Viris I suppose, the V becoming F, in accordance with Grimm's Law. 
 
The rest you know. 
You say nothing?
Say something, Maddy. 
Say you believe me.

I remember once attending a lecture by one of these new mind doctors, I forget what you call them. He spoke--

A lunatic specialist? 

No no, just the troubled mind, I was hoping he might shed a little light on my lifelong preoccupation with horses' buttocks.

A neurologist.

No no, just mental distress, 
the name will come back to me in the night. 
I remember his telling us the story 
of a little girl, very strange and 
unhappy in her ways, 
and how he treated her unsuccessfully 
over a period of years 
and was finally obliged 
to give up the case. 
He could find nothing wrong with her, 
he said. The only thing wrong with her 
as far as he could see was 
that she was dying. 
And she did in fact die, 
shortly after he [just as soon as he had] washed his hands of her. 
Well? What is there so wonderful about that?
No, it was just something he said, 
and the way he said it, 
that have haunted me ever since.
You lie awake at night, tossing to and fro and brooding on it.
On it and other . . . wretchedness. 
When he had done with the little girl he stood there motionless for some time, quite two minutes I should say, looking down at his table. Then he suddenly raised his head and exclaimed, as if he bad had a revelation, The trouble with her was she had never been really born!
He spoke throughout without notes. 
I left before the end.
Nothing about your buttocks? 
Maddy!
There is nothing to be done for those people!
For which is there?
That does not sound right somehow.
What way am I facing?
What?
I have forgotten what way I am facing.
You have turned aside and are bowed down over the ditch.
There is a dead dog down there.
No no, just the rotting leaves.
In June? Rotting leaves in June?
Yes dear, 
from last year, 
and from ["from" missing] the year before last [that], 
and from ["from" missing] the year before that again. 
There is that lovely laburnum again. 
Poor thing, it is losing all its tassels. 
There are the first drops. 
Golden drizzle. 
Do not mind me, dear, I am just talking to myself. 
Can hinnies procreate, I wonder.
Say that again.
Come on, dear, don't mind me, we are getting drenched.
Can what what?
Hinnies procreate. 
You know,
No.
Then why do you stop?
It is easier.
Are you very wet?
To the buff.
The buff?
The buff. From buffalo.
We shall hang up all our things in the hotcupboard and get into our dressing-gowns. (Pause.) Put your arm round me. 
Be nice to me! 
Ah Dan! 
All day the same old record. All alone in that great empty house. She must be a very old woman now.
Death and the Maiden.
You are crying. 
Are you crying?
Yes! 
Who is the preacher to-morrow? The incumbent?
No.
Thank God for that. Who?
Hardy.
"How to be Happy though Married"?
No no, he died, you remember. No connexion.
Has he announced the text?
"The Lord upholdeth all that fall and raiseth up all those that be bowed down." 
Hold me tighter, Dan!  
Oh yes!
I hear something behind us.
It looks like Jerry. 
It is Jerry.
You dropped--
Take your time, my little man, you will burst a bloodvessel.
You dropped something, Sir, Mr. Barrell told me to run after you.
Show. 
What is it?  
What is this thing, Dan?
Perhaps it is not mine at all.
Mr. Barrell said it was, Sir.
It looks like a kind of ball. And yet it is not a ball.
Give it to me.
What is it, Dan?
It is a thing I carry about with me.
Yes, but what--
It is a thing I carry about with me!
I have no small money. Have you?
I have none of any kind.
We are out of change, Jerry. Remind Mr. Rooney on Monday and he will give you a penny for your pains.
Yes, Ma'am.
If I am alive.
Yessir.
Jerry!
Did you hear what the hitch was? 
Did you hear what kept the train so late?
How would he have heard? Come on.
What was it, Jerry?
It was a--
Leave the boy alone, he knows nothing! Come on!
What was it, Jerry?
It was a little child, Ma'am.
What do you mean, it was a little child?
It was a little child fell out of the carriage, On to the line, Ma'am. 
Under the wheels, Ma'am.
